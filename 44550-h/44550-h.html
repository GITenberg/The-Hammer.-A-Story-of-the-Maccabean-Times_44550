        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not so very
        long since the Apocrypha was found in almost every copy of the
        English Bible, but in the present day it is seldom printed with it,
        and very seldom indeed read. One or two of the writings included
        under this name are trivial and even absurd; but, on the whole, the
        Apocryphal books deserve far more attention than they receive. Among
        the foremost, in point of interest and value, must be placed the
        First Book of Maccabees. Written within fifty years of the events
        which it records, at a time, it must be remembered, that was
        singularly barren of historical literature, it is a careful, sober,
        and consistent narrative. It is our principal, not unfrequently our
        sole, authority for the incidents of a very important period, a
        period that was in the highest degree critical in the history of the
        Jewish nation and of the world which that nation has so largely
        influenced. It is commonly said that the great visitation of the
        Captivity finally destroyed in the Hebrew mind the tendency to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id=
        "Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>idolatry. But the denunciations of
        Ezekiel prove to us that the exiles carried into the land of their
        captivity the evil which they had cherished in the land of their
        birth, and it is no less certain that they brought it back with them
        on their return. It grew to its height in the early part of the
        Second Century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span>, along with the increasing
        influence of Greek civilization in Western Asia. The feeble Jewish
        Commonwealth was more and more dominated by the powerful kingdoms
        which had been established on the ruins of the empire of Alexander,
        and the national religion was attacked by an enemy at least as
        dangerous as the Phœnician Baal-worship had been in earlier days, an
        enemy which may be briefly described by the word Hellenism. The story
        of how Judas and his brothers led the movement which rescued the
        Jewish faith from this peril is the story which we have endeavoured
        to tell in this volume. Our plan has been to follow strictly the
        lines of the First Book of Maccabees, going to the Second, a far less
        trustworthy document, only for some picturesque incidents. The
        subsidiary characters are fictitious, but the narrative is, we
        believe, apart from casual errors, historically correct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have to
        acknowledge special obligations to Captain Conder’s <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Judas Maccabæus,”</span> a volume of the series entitled
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The New Plutarch.”</span> We also owe much
        to Canon Rawlinson’s notes in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Speaker’s
        Commentary on the Bible,”</span> to Canon <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Westcott’s articles in the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dictionary of the Bible,”</span> and to Dean Stanley’s
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lectures on the Jewish Church.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If any reader
        should be curious as to the literary partnership announced on the
        title-page—a partnership that has grown, so to speak, out of another
        of many years’ standing, shared by the writers as author and
        publisher—he may be informed that the plan of the story and a
        detailed outline of it have been contributed by Richmond Seeley, and
        the story itself written for the most part by Alfred Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time is the
        evening of a day in the early autumn of the year 174 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> There
        has been a great festival in Jerusalem. But it has been curiously
        unlike any festival that one would have expected to be held in that
        famous city. The people have not been crowding in from the country,
        and journeying from their far-off places of sojourn among the
        heathen, to keep one of the great feasts of the Law. Nothing could be
        further from the thoughts of the crowd that is streaming out of this
        new building which stands close under the walls of the Temple. What
        would they who built the Temple some two and a half centuries before
        have thought of this strange intruder on the sacred precincts? It is
        not difficult to imagine, for the new erection is nothing more or
        less than a Circus, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg
        2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>built
        and furnished in the latest Greek fashion, and the spectacle which
        the crowd has been enjoying, or pretending to enjoy—for it is strange
        to all, and distasteful to some—is an imitation of the Olympian
        games. Things then, we see, have been curiously changed. Even the
        city has almost lost its identity. It is no longer the capital of the
        Jewish nation, but the chief town of an insignificant province in the
        Greek kingdom of Syria, one of the fragments into which the great
        dominion of Alexander had split some hundred and fifty years before.
        We shall understand something more about this marvellous change if we
        listen to a conversation that is going on in one of the houses that
        adjoin the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, Cleon, you will allow that our little show to-day
        has been fairly successful. We are but novices, you know; barbarians,
        I am afraid you will call us. But we hope to improve. You Greeks are
        wonderful teachers. You can give in a very short time a quite
        marvellous appearance of refinement to the merest savages. And we are
        not that; you would not call us savages, my dear friend.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Savages! The gods forbid that such insolent folly should
        ever come from my tongue! You have a most elegant taste in art, my

        apartment.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg
        3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, as he spoke,
        Cleon looked round the room, which, indeed, was very handsomely
        furnished in the latest Greek taste. The walls were covered with
        tapestry, showing on a purple ground a design, worked in silver and
        gold, which represented the triumphant return of the Wine-god from
        his Eastern campaigns. At one end of the room stood a
        sumptuously-carved bookcase, filled with volumes adorned by the most
        skilful binders of Alexandria. The bookcase was flanked on either
        side by a pedestal statue, one displaying the head of Hermes, the
        other the head of Athené. On a sideboard were ranged twelve silver
        goblets, on which had been worked in high relief the labours of
        Hercules. But probably the most precious object in the room—at least
        in its master’s estimation—was a replica, about half the size of
        life, of the statue that we know as the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dying Gladiator.”</span> It was the work of a sculptor
        of Pergamum, a special favourite of the art-loving dynasty of the
        Attali. It had been purchased for the enormous sum of half a talent
        of gold;<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> and Jason
        had thought himself especially fortunate in being allowed to secure
        it on any terms. The Pergamene artist was bound, in consideration of
        the handsome payment which he received from his royal patron, not to
        execute commissions for strangers, and it was only as a special
        favour, and not till a heavy bribe had been <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>paid to some influential personage in the court,
        that the rule had been relaxed in favour of Jason.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And who, it may be
        asked, was Jason?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jason was the
        Jewish high priest, the successor of Aaron, of Eleazar, of Jehoiada,
        of Hilkiah, and as unlike these worthies of the past in appearance,
        in speech, in ways of thinking, as it is possible to conceive. His
        costume, in the first place, was that of a Greek exquisite. He wore a
        purple tunic, showing at the neck a crimson under-shirt, and gathered
        up at the waist with a belt of the finest leather, clasped with a
        design in silver, which showed a dog laying hold of a fawn. His knees
        were bare, but the shins were covered with silk leggings of the same
        colour as the tunic, against which the gold fastenings of the sandals
        showed in gay relief. His hair was elaborately curled, and almost
        dripping with the richest of Syrian perfumes. The forefinger of the
        left hand showed the head of Zeus finely carved on an amethyst, that
        of the right was circled by a sapphire ring with the likeness of
        Apollo.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His speech was
        Greek. Hebrew of course he knew, both in its classical and its
        conversational forms; but he was as careful to conceal his knowledge
        as an old-fashioned Roman of his time would have been careful to hide
        the fact, if he had happened to know any language besides his own.
        His very name, it will have been observed, had been changed to suit
        the new fashion which he was endeavouring <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to set to his countrymen. Really it was
        Joshua—no dishonourable appellation, one would think, seeing that it
        had been borne by the conqueror of Canaan, and by the most
        distinguished of the later high priests. But it did not please him,
        and he had changed it to Jason.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for his ways of
        thinking, these will become evident enough if we listen to a little
        more of his conversation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And you think, Cleon,”</span> he went on—Cleon was a
        Greek adventurer who gave himself out as an Athenian, but who was
        shrewdly suspected of coming from one of the smaller islands of the
        Ægean—<span class="tei tei-q">“you think that our games went pretty
        well?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Admirably, my dear Jason,”</span> answered the Greek,
        who really had thought them a deplorable failure, but who valued too
        much his free quarters in the high priest’s sumptuous palace to give
        a candid expression of his opinion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You see we had great difficulties to contend with. You
        can hardly imagine, for instance, how hard I found it to persuade our

        obsolete old rules that no sensible person would think for a moment
        of observing.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=

        loin-cloth. They positively refused to come into the arena without
        it. Well, we shall educate them in time. They <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></span>
        learn to admire the beauty of the human form, unspoilt by any of the
        trappings with which, for convenience sake, we are accustomed to
        conceal it. I don’t despair of our having a school of art here some
        day—not rivals, my dear <span class="tei tei-sic">Lysias</span>, of
        your glorious Phidias and Praxiteles, but imitators, humble
        imitators, whom yet you won’t disdain to acknowledge.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But, my dear sir, you forget the Commandment,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven
        image.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The speaker was a
        young man who had hitherto taken no part in the conversation. He also
        had a Hebrew name and a Greek. His father, a rich priest who claimed
        descent from no less a person than the prophet Ezekiel, had called
        him Micah; but he had followed the fashion, and dubbed himself
        Menander. Still, Greek ways and habits did not sit over-easily upon
        him. Fashion has often a singular power over the young; but it could
        not quite drive out the obstinate patriotism of the Jew. He could
        still sometimes be scandalized at the thorough-going Hellenism of the
        high priest; and he was so scandalized now. The Commandment was one
        of the things which he had learnt at his mother’s knee, and which he
        had solemnly repeated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg
        7]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>when,
        at the age of twelve, he had been regularly admitted to the
        privileges of a <span class="tei tei-q">“son of the Law.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My dear Menander,”</span> broke in the high priest,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“what can you be thinking about? I had hoped
        better things of you. You do discourage me most terribly.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘No graven image or likeness of anything that
        is in heaven or earth!’</span> Was there ever anything so hopelessly
        tasteless? Why, this is the one thing that has checked all growth of
        art among us? And without art where is the beauty of life? Now tell
        me, Menander, did you ever see anything so hideous as the Temple?
        There is a certain splendour about it—or was, till I had to strip off
        most of the gold for purposes of state—but of beauty or taste not a
        scrap. You, Cleon, have never seen the inside of it. Well, you have
        lost nothing. It would simply shock you after your lovely Parthenon.
        Bells and pomegranates—things that any moulder could make—and sham
        columns, and everything as bad as it can be. And then the dresses!
        You should see—though I should really be ashamed if you did see
        it—the absurd costume that some of them would make me wear as high
        priest. Anything more cumbrous and clumsy could not be. A man can
        hardly move in it; and as for showing any of the proportions of the
        figure—and I take it that dress is meant to reveal while it seems to
        hide them—one might as well be wrapped up in swaddling
        clothes.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg
        8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did you ever wear it?”</span> asked Cleon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Once, and once only,”</span> answered Jason.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That was on the day when I was admitted to
        the office. You see it had to be done. Some of my enemies—and I am
        afraid that I have enemies after all that I have done for this
        ungrateful people—might have said that things were not regular
        without it, and when one has paid twenty talents of gold for the
        office, it would be rank folly to risk it for a trifle. But I have
        never worn it since, and never mean to again. I did design something
        much lighter and neater, worthy the Greek fashion, but with just a
        tinge—it would be well to have a tinge—of our own in it; but it did
        not please the elders when I showed it to them, a bigoted set of
        fools!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But your worship is very fine, I am told,”</span> said
        the Greek.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very tasteless, very tasteless,”</span> answered the
        high-priest, <span class="tei tei-q">“the singing and music as rude
        as possible. I tried to improve them when I first came into office.
        When I was at Antioch I saw some very pretty performances in the
        groves of Daphne, and I wanted to remodel our ceremonies on something
        of the same lines. Of course I could not transplant them just as they
        were: you will guess that there were one or two things that would
        hardly do here. I am not strait-laced, as you know, but there are
        limits. However, it all came to nothing. Our people are so clumsy and
        obstinate. So the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg
        9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>only
        thing will be to let these antiquated ceremonies die out by
        degrees.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah broke in at
        this point. Disposed as he was to follow Jason’s lead, this was going
        too far. <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely, my dear sir, if you take
        away from us all that is distinctive, where will be our reason for

        me. Why, my fellows, the tax-gatherers, are the most ingenious
        rascals in the world for putting on the screw. I make them bid
        against each other when I put the taxes up to auction, and they
        really go to figures that I should not have thought possible. And
        then, after all, they manage somehow or other to get a handsome
        margin of profit for themselves. I know the scoundrels always seem to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menander, somewhat
        revolted at his friend’s levity, rose to take leave. <span class=

        charming fellows, those Greek friends of yours,”</span> he went on,
        addressing Cleon, <span class="tei tei-q">“but they have the most
        confounded luck with the dice that I ever knew. But what is it, sir,
        that you want me to do?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I want to do a civil thing to our friends at Tyre. You
        know that we do a very brisk trade with them, and a little bit of
        politeness is never thrown away. Well, next month they have the great
        games of Hercules, and I want you to take a present to the Governor,
        and, as you will be there, just a trifle—a silver tripod, or
        something of the kind—for Hercules himself. The Tyrian people would
        take it amiss, I fancy, if you went quite empty-handed.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah—for at the
        moment he felt much more like a Micah than a Menander—flushed all
        over. <span class="tei tei-q">“I take a present to the idol at Tyre!
        You must be joking; but, with all respect, sir, it is a joke which I
        do not appreciate.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, my dear Menander,”</span> said the high priest,
        with a laugh, <span class="tei tei-q">“why all this fuss? You must
        excuse me for saying so, but you are really a little stupid this
        morning. What nonsense to talk about idols! The Greek heroes are
        really the same as our own. Hercules is nothing more or less than
        Samson <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name=
        "Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>under another name. You
        will find in every country the legend of some strong man who goes
        about killing wild beasts and slaying his enemies, and doing all
        kinds of wonders; and it does not become an enlightened man like
        yourself to fancy that our hero is anything better than another
        nation’s hero. However, think the matter over. If you don’t choose to
        go there are plenty who will, and Tyre, I am told, is still worth
        seeing, though, of course, it is nothing like what it
        was.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment a
        servant burst somewhat unceremoniously into the room.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How now, fellow?”</span> cried the high priest,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Where are your manners? Don’t you know that
        I have company and am not to be interrupted?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pardon, my lord,”</span> said the man, in a breathless,
        agitated voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“but the matter is urgent.
        Your nephew Asaph is dying, and has sent begging you to come to
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Asaph dying!”</span> cried the high priest, turning
        pale. <span class="tei tei-q">“How is that?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Asaph had been one
        of the performers in the exhibition of the day. A light weight, but
        an exceedingly active and skilful wrestler, he had entered the lists
        with a competitor much stronger and heavier than himself. The
        struggle between the two athletes had been protracted and fierce and
        had ended in a draw. There had been two bouts, but in neither had
        this or that antagonist been able <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to claim a decided success. In each, both
        wrestlers had fallen, Asaph being uppermost in the first, but
        underneath in the second. On rising from the ground he had complained
        of severe internal pains; but these had seemed to pass away, and he
        had been conveyed in a litter to his mother’s house. After a brief
        interval the pains had returned with increased severity; vomiting of
        blood had followed, and the physician had declared that the resources
        of his art were useless. The poor lad—he was but a few months over
        twenty—sent, in his agony, for his uncle the high priest. It was a
        forlorn hope—for how could such a man give comfort?—but it was the
        only one that occurred to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No one was more
        conscious of the incongruity of the task thus imposed upon him, the
        task of administering consolation and comfort to the dying, than
        Jason himself. His first impulse was to refuse to go. But to do so
        would not only cause a scandal, but would also be the beginning of a
        family feud. And Jason, though selfish and hardened by base
        ambitions, was not wholly without a heart. He had some affection for
        his sister, a widow of large means, whose purse was always open to
        him when he wanted help, and Asaph—or Asius, as he preferred to call
        him—was his favourite nephew, possibly his successor in his office.
        He felt that he must go, but it was with a miserable sinking of heart
        that he felt it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The worldly priest
        might well have dreaded to enter the house of woe to which he had
        been called.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unhappy mother
        met him at the door. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, Joshua!”</span> she
        cried, the foolish affectation of the Greek name being forgotten in
        the hour of trouble. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can you help us? My
        dear Asaph is dying, and he is terribly distressed about his sins.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Take me to him,”</span> said Jason, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will do all that I can for him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unhappy lad
        was lying on a couch, the deathly pallor of his face showing with a
        terrible contrast against the rich purple of the coverlet. His eyes
        were wide open, and there was a terror-stricken look in them that was
        inexpressibly painful to witness. As soon as he saw his uncle, he
        burst forth in tones of agonized entreaty. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        have sinned; I have sinned; I have followed in the ways of the
        heathen, and, see, my God hath called me into judgment. Help me! help
        me! Save me from the fire of Gehenna!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The high priest
        strove to say something; but his faltering lips seemed to refuse to
        do their office.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Speak! speak!”</span> cried the young man. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was you who told me to go into the arena. You
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015"
        id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said there was no harm in it;
        you encouraged me, and now you desert me. O help me!”</span> and his
        voice, which had been raised to a loud, angry cry, sank again to low
        tones of entreaty. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are high priest; you
        surely can do something with the Lord. Pray for me to Him. Quick!
        quick! the evil ones are clutching at me!”</span> and, as he spoke,
        he turned his eyes with a fearful glance as if he saw some terrible
        presence which was invisible to the rest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His uncle, more
        unhappy than he had ever been before in his life, stood in dumb
        despair. It seemed impossible to mock this wretched creature with
        words in which he did not himself believe. And, indeed, the words
        themselves seemed to have fled altogether from his memory. At last,
        with a tremendous effort, he summoned up some of the words, once
        familiar to his lips, but which had not issued from them for years.
        It was what we know as the fifty-first Psalm in our psalter that he
        began—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Have mercy upon me, O God, after Thy great
        goodness, according to the multitude of Thy mercies do away mine
        offences.</span></span>”</span> He began with a faltering and
        uncertain voice, which gathered strength as he went on. The dying man
        listened with an eagerly-strained attention, and the words seemed to
        have some soothing effect upon him. When the speaker came to the
        words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cast me not away from Thy
        presence,”</span> he clasped his hands together. At the very moment
        of the act a strong <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg
        16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>convulsion shook his frame: a stream of blood
        gushed from his mouth; in another moment Asaph was dead.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His unhappy mother
        had been carried fainting to her apartments, where her maids were
        endeavouring to restore her to consciousness. The high priest was
        almost glad that she was in such a state that there could be no
        question of attempting to administer to her any consolation. No one,
        indeed, could have felt less like a comforter than he did at that
        moment. As he walked slowly back to his palace he felt less satisfied
        with the Greek fashions, for which he had sacrificed the faith of his
        fathers, than he had done for many years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The news that he
        found awaiting him at home changed the current of his thoughts. A
        letter, carried, in Eastern fashion, by a succession of runners, had
        arrived from Joppa. It was as follows:—</p>

        know so soon as shall be possible how the heathen should be received,

        the task of entertaining him. Farewell.</span><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jason’s face
        flushed as he read this curt and not very courteous epistle.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Governor of Jerusalem, indeed!”</span> he
        muttered to himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“So the old bigot

        enough that there will be mischief here, if I don’t take care. It
        won’t be enough to write. I must send some of my own people to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He pressed a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater part
        of the population of Joppa, which, like most seaside towns, was
        somewhat cosmopolitan in its habits and ways of thinking, had hurried
        down to the shore to watch the arrival of the great Syrian King. And,
        indeed, his fleet was a sight worth seeing. Thirty ships, all of them
        with three banks of oars, were formed in a semicircle, the arc of
        which was parallel with the line of the shore. They were war-vessels,
        the finest and swiftest that the Syrian fleet possessed, manned with
        picked crews, and now gay with all the sumptuous adornments that
        befitted a peaceful errand. The day was perfectly windless, and the
        sea as calm as a lake. This circumstance made it possible for the
        squadron to preserve the order of its advance with an exactitude
        which would not have been possible had it been moving under sail. On
        the prow of each vessel stood a flute-player, and the rowers dipped
        their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name=
        "Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>oars in time to his
        music. Each player had his eyes fixed on a conductor who was posted
        on the royal vessel, a five-banked ship, which occupied a position
        slightly in advance of the semicircle. Time was thus kept throughout
        the squadron—a result, however, not obtained, as may easily be
        imagined, without a vast amount of practice. The sight of the
        thousands of oars, as they were dipped and lifted again in rhythmical
        regularity, with the sunshine flashing upon them, was beautiful in
        the extreme. As for the ship that carried King Antiochus, it was a
        gorgeous spectacle. The ropes were of gaily-coloured silk; the hull
        was brilliant with gold. The figure-head was the head and bust of a
        sea-nymph, exquisitely wrought in silver. The poop was covered with a
        crimson awning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the squadron
        approached the harbour, a convenience which the Joppa of to-day no
        longer possesses, the royal ship fell back, allowing the leading
        vessels on either side of the semicircle to precede it to the pier.
        From these a company of troops, splendidly arrayed in gilded armour,
        disembarked, and formed two lines, between which the King was to
        walk.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Syrian King
        was a young man of about two-and-twenty years, tall, and well made,
        and not without a certain dignity of presence. His face, too, at
        first sight would have been pronounced handsome. It was of the true
        Greek type: the forehead and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg
        21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nose
        forming an almost uninterrupted straight line. This line, however,
        receded too much, giving something of an expression of weakness. But
        for this the features of the young Syrian king might have been
        described as bearing a singular resemblance to those of the great
        Alexander. Youthful as he was, his complexion, naturally of a
        beautiful delicacy, was already flushed with excess. But the most
        sinister characteristic of his face was to be found in the restless
        look of his prominent eyes. The descendants of the brilliant soldier,
        the ablest and most upright of the generals of Alexander, who had
        founded the Syrian kingdom, had sadly degenerated under the
        corrupting influences of power. The hideous example of lust and
        cruelty had been set and improved upon by generation after
        generation, till the fatal taint of madness, always the avenger of
        such wickedness, had been developed in the race.<a id="noteref_3"
        name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Council of
        Joppa had sent a deputation of their body, headed by their president,
        Josedech, to receive the visitor with such respect as might lawfully
        be shown to a heathen. Greeting and compliments could be exchanged
        without any loss of ceremonial purity. Nor would there be any harm in
        presenting a gift. To sit down to meat with an <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unbeliever, was, of course, out of the
        question; but this difficulty had been overcome by the complaisance
        of a wealthy Greek merchant, who, for sufficient reasons of his own,
        had offered to entertain the visitor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The councillors
        saluted the King, not with the extravagant form of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Live for ever!”</span> but with the more moderate form
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace be with you.”</span> Antiochus
        answered with a careless greeting. At the same time he turned to one
        of his courtiers, and said in a whisper which was heard, as it was
        meant to be heard, by others besides the persons addressed,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Look! what a set of he-goats. And faugh! how
        they smell!”</span> The young King, who was exceedingly vain of his
        good looks, had the fancy of making himself up as the beardless
        Apollo, and, of course, the court followed the fashion that he set.
        The insulting words did not fail to reach the ears of the elders, but
        they affected not to have heard them. The president then proceeded to
        deliver his address of welcome. It was sufficiently civil, but, as
        may be supposed, not enthusiastic. The speaker hoped that friendly
        relations might continue to exist between the Jewish people and the
        kingdom of Syria. He was glad to receive on Jewish soil a powerful
        monarch who, he trusted, would be favourably impressed with what he
        should see and hear. If his subjects had any grievances they would
        find <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name=
        "Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prompt redress; the
        King would doubtless do the same for Jewish merchants who considered
        themselves aggrieved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this address,
        which, after the manner of such documents, was somewhat verbose and
        lengthy, Antiochus listened with ill-concealed impatience; perhaps it
        would be more correct to say, with impatience that was not concealed
        at all. He fidgeted about; he interjected disparaging remarks that
        must have been distinctly heard a long way off. He even corrected the
        speaker when he made a slip in Greek idiom. Still the elders
        preserved an imperturbable calm, though a keen observer might have
        seen the flush rising upon their faces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The address of
        welcome ended, it only remained to offer the customary present. An
        attendant stepped forward carrying a robe of honour, a piece of
        native manufacture, which, without being particularly splendid, was
        sufficiently handsome and valuable to be adequate to the occasion.
        But it did not please the young King, who, indeed, was scarcely in
        the humour to be pleased with anything. One of his followers received
        it from the hands of the attendant, and Antiochus, according to the
        usual etiquette, should have touched it, saying at the same time a
        few words of politeness. What he did was to take it from the hands of
        the courtier who had received it, shake it out, and hold it from him
        at arm’s length, eyeing it, at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the same time, with an expression of undisguised
        contempt. Even this was not all. Turning his back upon the elders he
        dropped the robe on the head of one of his attendants, and, by a
        sudden movement, twisted it round his neck, bursting out at the same
        time into a loud horse-laugh. The laugh was, of course, dutifully
        echoed by his courtiers; but to the Joppa crowd it seemed no laughing
        matter. An angry murmur ran through it. The front ranks made a
        menacing movement forwards, while stones began to fly from behind. On
        the other hand, the soldiers of the King’s body-guard drew their
        swords, and began to form up behind him. They were not properly
        prepared, however, for a conflict; for, as they had come only on a
        service of ceremony, they had nothing with them but their swords and
        light ornamental breastplates.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything wore a
        most threatening look, when there occurred an interruption that was
        probably welcome to every one, except, it may be, the hotheaded and
        reckless young sovereign himself. The deputation from Jerusalem had
        arrived. The high priest, anticipating, as we have seen, some
        trouble, had despatched them at the very earliest opportunity, and
        had urged them to make the best of their way to their destination. At
        the same time, that their presence might have something more than
        moral weight, he had sent a squadron of cavalry. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The deputation, with their escort
        following close behind, now made their way through the crowd.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The high priest
        was represented by his kinsman Phinehas—who had found a substitute
        for his unfashionable name in Phineus—by Menander, who has been
        already mentioned, and by two Greeks, of whom our acquaintance Cleon
        was one. Josedech and his companions willingly left the management of
        affairs in the hands of the new arrivals, and retired from the scene.
        Leaping from his horse, Phinehas, or Phineus, prostrated himself in
        Eastern fashion at the feet of Antiochus, and his companions followed
        his example, while the escort of cavalry saluted. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rise,”</span> said Antiochus, whose good humour began to
        return when he found himself treated with what he conceived to be
        proper respect. He even condescended to reach out his royal hand, and
        assist the envoy to recover his feet. Phineus proceeded to deliver an
        address of welcome which was certainly not wanting in florid
        compliment. It might even have been called profane, for Antiochus was
        described not only as magnificent, illustrious, victorious (to
        mention a few only of the speaker’s exuberant supply of epithets),
        but even as divine. The speech ended, an attendant presented a
        richly-chased casket of gold, filled with coins, fresh from the
        Syrian mint, and bearing the features and superscription of Antiochus
        himself. The King received it with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>something like <span lang="fr" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">empressement</span></span>, and after speaking a
        few words of thanks, passed it to his treasurer. At the same time he
        took a bag of silver from one of his attendants, and condescended to
        scatter some of the pieces among the crowd that lined the quays, with
        his royal hands. As may be supposed, a vigorous scramble ensued, and
        not a few of the spectators were tumbled over the edge into the
        shallow water below. Others jumped in of their own accord after some
        of the pieces which had fallen short. A general burst of laughter was
        the result, and the situation lost the gravity which had been so
        alarming a few minutes before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The King now
        recognized an old acquaintance in Cleon. Antiochus, handed over in
        his childhood as a hostage by his father, had spent his boyhood and
        youth in Rome. The somewhat austere manners of that city had not
        pleased him, and he was glad to find in the young Greek an
        acquaintance more congenial than the young Marcelli, sons of the
        priest of that name, under whose charge he had been put. Cleon had
        come to Rome to seek his fortune, and had found employment in
        assisting the comic poet Cæcilius in making his translations from the
        Greek. Poets, however, were not so well paid as to be able to spare
        much for their assistants, and Cleon had been very glad to act as the
        young prince’s teacher, a post which his guardian the priest had
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027"
        id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>found it very difficult to
        fill. Tutor and pupil had been on the most friendly terms. The elder
        man was indulgent, exacted no more than the youth was willing to
        learn, and, possibly thinking that all the necessary austerity was
        supplied by the Roman guardian, winked at various indulgences which
        would not have approved themselves to his employer. Antiochus
        retained a grateful recollection of the complaisant youth who had
        made things so agreeable for him in the days of his captivity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hail, Cleon, most delightful of teachers, behold the
        most thankful of pupils!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he embraced
        the Greek, kissing him on both cheeks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So you, too,”</span> he went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“have escaped from that dismal prison-house across the
        sea! Was there ever a place, think you, more unfit for a gentleman to
        live in? And how have you fared since I saw you? I hope that Fortune
        has had something pleasant in store for you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She could have done nothing better, Sire, than to thus
        give me the pleasure of seeing you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, what a compliment! I see that your tongue has not
        lost its dexterous twist. But I suppose I must attend to this stupid
        business here. Why can’t they let one come quietly, and see what
        people really are. I dare say there are some good fellows here as
        elsewhere; but all these ceremonies and speech-making and fine
        clothes tire me to death. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg
        28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Well,
        we shall find a chance of having some talk together before long.
        Anyhow, you will come and see me at Antioch. I will make you
        court-poet, or general-in-chief, or high priest of Aphrodite! I know
        that you can do anything that you choose to turn your hand
        to.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While this
        conversation was going on the Greek merchant who had volunteered to
        entertain the royal visitor was waiting to be introduced. This
        ceremony performed by Phineus, he proceeded to give his
        invitation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Will your Highness be pleased to accept such humble
        hospitality as I can offer? My house and all that is within it are at
        your service.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pleased! of course I shall be pleased,”</span> returned
        the King, in boisterous good humour. <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
        what your <span class="tei tei-q">‘humble hospitality’</span> means.
        It is you merchants that can afford to do things handsomely. You make
        the money, and we can only spend it. What with armies and fleets and
        legions of servants, who eat us up like so many locusts, we never
        have a drachma that we can call our own. As for me, I am easily
        satisfied. Give me a mullet, a piece of roast kid, a flask of good
        wine, and a pretty girl to hand the cup, and I want no more. Lead
        on.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
        moved on to the merchant’s house. This reached, the King, who
        declared that he wanted his midday sleep, was at once shown to his
        apartments.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg
        29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was some six
        hours later when the banquet, for which the host had made magnificent
        preparations, was ready. The company was assembled, and was fairly
        numerous, though it did not contain the true <span lang="fr" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">élite</span></span> of Joppa society. With one
        or two not very respectable exceptions, the representatives of the
        high-class Jewish families were absent. But there were plenty of
        strangers in the town, and the room was sufficiently full. The
        trading community was present in force: Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians,
        Carthaginians, and even a Greek-speaking Gaul from Marseilles, were
        present. Rome was represented by two Roman knights, who were doing a
        profitable business in money-lending, and who had the name of pretty
        nearly every noble in Syria on their books.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the guest of
        the evening was absent. The company waited with the patience with
        which royal personages are waited for on such occasions. At last,
        when an hour had gone beyond the time fixed for the entertainment,
        the host ventured to send up to the King’s apartment, with a humble
        reminder that the banquet was ready. But the apartment was empty!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What can have become of him?”</span> was the thought in
        every one’s mind, not unaccompanied by a certain anxiety in the older
        courtiers, who had observed with dismay the reckless proceedings of
        their master.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last a thought
        struck Cleon. He took the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg
        30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chief
        of the King’s attendants aside and communicated to him his
        suspicions. <span class="tei tei-q">“I saw something of his
        Highness’s ways at Rome,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and I can guess what has happened. He always had a fancy
        for disguises, for dressing himself up as a sailor or an artizan, and
        going to some very curious places in the city. Often and often have I
        been with him—to keep him out of mischief, you know—and, by the gods!
        it was well I did. I remember his being very nearly stabbed one night
        in a low wine-shop in the Suburra.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4"
        href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> And now I
        remember that this morning his Highness said something about wanting
        to see what the people really were, without all this ceremony. Let us
        question the porter whether he has seen any one go out.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The porter was
        questioned accordingly. At first he could give no information. At
        last he remembered observing two young men in sailor’s dress passing
        the gate about three hours before. He had taken no heed of them.
        Sailors had been coming and going all day, with various articles
        which they were bringing up from the ship, and he had supposed that
        these were two of the number. Here the man’s wife struck in with the
        information that she had noticed the two sailors, thinking that there
        was something odd about their appearance; their clothes were very
        shabby, but they had a superior <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>air. Neither the man nor his wife knew anything
        more; but they thought that the two had turned in the direction of
        the harbour after leaving the house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
        circumstances search seemed hopeless, and might, indeed, do more harm
        than good. Perhaps the safest plan would be to let the young man find
        his way back for himself. After some discussion, however, it was
        resolved that Cleon, after first changing the dress which he had
        donned for the banquet for something less conspicuous, should look in
        at some of the wine-shops near the harbour, which were suggested as
        likely places for the search by the character of the King’s
        disguise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon was
        successful beyond his expectation. His attention was attracted by the
        sound of boisterous laughter proceeding from a tavern whose windows
        fronted the place where the King had landed. The place was crowded to
        overflowing, and even the pavement before the house was thronged with
        idlers, who were content to hear what they could of the fun inside
        without having any score to pay. With no little difficulty Cleon
        edged his way into the principal room. It was a strange scene that
        met his eye. The room was crowded with Phœnician and Greek sailors,
        with here and there the swarthy face of a Moor among them. The guests
        sat on benches, closely packed together, and every one had a huge
        earthenware cup in his hand and a pitcher of wine at his feet. At the
        further end of the room <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg
        32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was a
        small platform reserved for the performers who were accustomed to
        entertain the audience. A couple of dancing-girls had just exhibited
        a dance of the boisterous kind which was specially favoured by the
        seafaring spectators; and now his Syrian Majesty was doing his best
        to entertain the company with the burlesque of a Roman electioneering
        oration. He spoke in Greek, or, rather, the mixture of tongues, the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Lingua
        Franca</span></span> of the time, which did duty for Greek in the
        seaport towns of the Eastern Mediterranean; and he used with
        considerable effect the broad Roman accent. His speech, could it be
        reproduced, would be dull or even unintelligible to us, but his
        audience found it highly entertaining. The Greeks, always
        quick-witted, caught the points with admirable readiness, and the
        others laughed, if not for any other reason, at least for sympathy.
        The most completely successful part was where the orator, who
        affected to be a candidate for the consulship, propounded a grand
        scheme, according to which the citizens of Rome were to live in
        idleness, supported by the contributions of the whole world. When the
        attention of the audience began to flag, the young Prince, with an
        audacious presence of mind that would have become a veteran
        performer, suddenly changed the entertainment. Sticking a tall cap on
        his head, he proceeded to give a ludicrous imitation of the solemn
        dance of the priests of Mars. Cleon had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>seen the original performance in Rome, and he
        could not but confess that the slow, awkward movement, and droning
        chant which the performer adapted to a popular song of a somewhat
        equivocal kind, was a very clever piece of work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few minutes
        afterwards Antiochus retired, breathless with his exertions, and
        Cleon made his way after him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So you are here,”</span> burst out the King.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Good, was it not?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Excellent, my lord,”</span> returned Cleon; <span class=

        banquet is ready, and the company are waiting for you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Confound the company; there is much better company here.
        I will stop where I am.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon remonstrated
        and argued; at first, it seemed, with no effect. Finally, however, by
        a judicious mixture of flattery and promises, and specially, by
        enlarging on the opportunity that there would be of electrifying the
        <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">élite</span></span> of Joppa by a display of
        eloquence, he induced the King to come away. Antiochus was eaten up
        with a vanity that was almost insane, and he was as proud of his
        capacity for serious oratory as he was of his talents as a
        buffoon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately the
        eloquence was never displayed. The King had drunk largely of the
        heady wine which was a favourite with the nautical customers of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034"
        id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tavern, and he applied himself
        with equal diligence to the more refined vintages which he found on
        the table of Stratocles, his entertainer. The company drank his
        health in bumpers; and, not to be outdone, a huge capacity for drink
        being, as he thought, one of his most honourable distinctions, he
        pledged them in return by draining a cup of a royal size. This was a
        final effort. He spoke a few hesitating sentences, frequently
        interrupted by hiccoughs, staggered, and but for the prompt attention
        of his attendants, who had indeed observed his condition, would have
        fallen to the ground. Nothing remained but to carry him out of the
        banqueting hall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was late in the
        afternoon of the following day before he was sufficiently recovered
        from the effects of his debauch to start for Jerusalem. A halt for
        the night was made about halfway, and late in the afternoon of the
        next day the cavalcade approached Jerusalem. Jason came out to meet
        his guest. He had done his utmost to bring a reputable company with
        him, but his efforts had not been very successful. The respectable
        part of the population of the city was conspicuously absent, a mixed
        multitude of strangers and half-breeds, brutal in manners and squalid
        in appearance, represented the Jewish nation. Fortunately it was
        dark, and the torchlight procession with which the King was escorted
        into the city did something to conceal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>by its picturesque effects the general meanness
        of the affair. Antiochus, however, did not fail to notice the
        character of the gathering, and indeed rallied his host on his ragged
        and disreputable followers. But his good humour did not seem to be
        disturbed. He admired the decorations of the palace, was loud in
        praise of Jason’s taste in art, and indeed admired one statuette so
        much that his host felt compelled to offer it for his acceptance,
        much against his will, for it was supposed to be an original by
        Scopas, and to be worth at least five talents. The next day came a
        visit to the Temple. The King shrugged his shoulders at what he was
        pleased to consider the tastelessness of its architecture, suggested
        to his host that he had better pull the whole place down and build it
        again in a better style, and offered him the services of his own
        architect and a painter who, he said, had a quite unequalled skill
        for such subjects as a dance of satyrs and nymphs, and would cover
        the walls of the new building with some really elegant designs. But
        if the architecture of the Temple did not please him, he expressed a
        genuine admiration for some of its contents. There was a greedy light
        in his eye as he looked at the rich furniture and gorgeous
        vessels—and this, though Jason, having certain views of his own, had
        the prudence not to show him the chamber which contained the most
        massive treasures of the place. But whatever Antiochus may have
        thought, he said nothing but what was civil and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pleasant. It may be supposed, however,
        that a few days of such a guest would be enough, and it was with
        unmixed delight that at the end of a week Jason saw him depart for
        Phenicé.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two years have
        passed, and the fate which Jason had declared to be beyond all limits
        of probability or possibility has actually overtaken him. One of his
        agents, named Oniah, who has assumed the name of Menelaüs, for the
        rage for Greek fashions still continues unabated, has outbidden him,
        and now reigns in his stead, occupying the palace on Mount Sion which
        he had been at such pains to adorn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we look into
        his library we shall see not only the books and statuettes—the silver
        tankards are gone, melted down into money that was wanted for some
        sudden exigency—but our old acquaintance, Cleon. The supple Greek was
        not one of those who take their friends for better, for worse. Jason
        was wandering about among the hills of Ammon with scarcely a garment
        to his back or a shekel that he could call his own, and what use
        could he find for the company of an accomplished gentleman, who had
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038"
        id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as keen an eye as any one for a
        fine bit of sculpture or painting, and could not be rivalled, out of
        the profession, in his taste for wine? The accomplished gentleman
        knew where he was appreciated, where he was of use, and, naturally,
        where he was well off. Accordingly he had found means, as such people
        always do find means, of ingratiating himself with the new occupant
        of the palace, and was installed as his consulting connoisseur and
        chief adviser in matters of taste.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A poor creature, certainly,”</span> he had replied to
        some depreciatory criticism which Menelaüs had passed on his
        predecessor, <span class="tei tei-q">“but it must be allowed that he
        had a taste in art.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Or was sensible enough to be guided by those who
        had,”</span> said Menelaüs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon acknowledged
        the compliment with a bow, and went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        never found him make any difficulty about the price. And, of course,
        if a man goes to work in that spirit, and has good advice, too, he is
        bound to make a fine collection.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menelaüs received
        the observation with a grimace, and a significant shrug of the
        shoulders. <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘No
        difficulty about the price,’</span> you say. Of course not. Why
        should he? When a man doesn’t pay, he is apt to be easy about the
        amount. Do you know that the bills for half the things that you see
        in this room have been sent in to me? Sometimes he had to pay the
        money down. The <span class="tei tei-q">‘Gladiator’</span> there,

        can eat or drink, lie down or get up, walk or ride, travel or stay at
        home, be born or marry, or be buried, without having to pay for it.
        No! I do not see room for another, and I am sure that it is not for
        want of looking. But, as I said, there are other ways. Now—can you

        is that salver, Alexander of Macedon gave it to the Temple; and that
        casket there was a present from the first Ptolemy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But, my dear sir,”</span> said the Greek, astonished at
        the audacity of the whole affair, <span class="tei tei-q">“is not
        this going a little too far? Suppose the people were to find it out?
        Would there not be a rather formidable uproar?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, of course; we cannot get anything without risk.
        But I have taken precautions. First, I have put a facsimile of every
        one of these in the Temple; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg
        43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>gilded lead, which does perfectly well for all
        practical purposes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But the weight! Surely any one can tell the difference
        by the weight.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course, my dear Cleon, I know that lead is little
        more than half as heavy as gold. But there are ways of making it up.
        You can put a great deal more metal in, without its being observed,
        and almost make up the difference. And, you see, the things are never
        allowed to be handled; can only be looked at. I have given very
        strict orders about that, you may be sure. Of course the treasurer is
        in the secret; but as he must sink or swim with me, he may be
        trusted. Besides, I am not going to run the risk of keeping them
        here. I can trust you, my good Cleon, as I can my own brother—in
        fact, when I come to think of it, a good deal more—yet I am not sure
        that I should have told you so much, but that the best of these are
        going to be packed off to-night. The fact is, they are sold
        already.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek could
        only shrug his shoulders and say nothing. As my readers will have
        perceived, he was not a man of high principles—in fact, to put the
        matter plainly, he was an unscrupulous adventurer. But the reckless
        villainy of Menelaüs fairly disgusted him. His taste, quite apart
        from any question of principle or honesty, revolted at the notion
        that a man, placed as was the high priest of the Jewish people,
        should deal with these historic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>treasures as a vulgar burglar might deal with
        them. This was a refinement of feeling into which the vulgar cupidity
        of Menelaüs did not enter. He went on:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How wild that scoundrel Jason would be, if he knew of
        this, to think that he had lost such an opportunity, had these
        treasures in his hand, so to speak, and leave them to his worst
        enemy!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have you heard anything lately about him?”</span> asked
        the Greek, not unwilling to change the subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, yes,”</span> replied Menelaüs, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he is wandering about somewhere in the country of the
        Ammonites, and at his wits’ end, I am told, how to live.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Poor fellow!”</span> said Cleon, <span lang="it" class=

        "font-style: italic">sotto voce</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he was always very kind to me, and I can’t help being
        sorry for him.”</span> He then went on aloud, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He will find it a great change from his way of living
        here.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, yes!”</span> said Menelaüs; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but still, some of his old ways and habits will come in
        usefully. He was always great about training, you remember. Every one
        should be ready to fight a boxing-match or run a race. Cold, hunger,
        fatigue; these, he used to say, are the things to bring out a man’s
        muscles. And now he has got them in perfection. He might really carry
        off some prize, only, unluckily, he is getting a little too old for
        that sort of thing. And then, you recollect, how he would go on about
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name=
        "Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beauty of the human
        form. Clothes, especially the gorgeous clothes of our people,
        obscured so tastelessly its magnificent proportions. Well, he has not
        much to complain of, I imagine, on that score. By the last account
        that I had of him he had as little in the way of clothing as a man
        could well have. Anyhow, he may console himself with thinking that
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">his</span></span> magnificent proportions are
        not obscured. Well, I don’t pity him. A man who has managed to get
        into a good place and then cannot stick to it is nothing better than
        a fool, and richly deserves everything that he may get.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point in
        the conversation a servant announced the arrival of a message from
        Sostratus, Governor of the Castle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All the gods and goddesses confound the man!”</span>
        cried the high priest, in a rage. He was fond of garnishing his
        conversation with a little Greek profanity. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Another dunning message, I suppose. Well, he must wait.
        No man can get any water by squeezing out of a dry sponge; and that

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The communication
        from Sostratus proved, however, to be on quite another subject,
        though it was, if possible, even more unwelcome. It ran thus:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menelaüs’s face
        visibly lengthened as he read this epistle. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By the dog!”</span> (this was a Socratic oath which he
        sometimes affected, as giving to his conversation a certain
        philosophic tinge)—<span class="tei tei-q">“By the dog! this is worse
        than being dunned! I like not a journey to Antioch. A very pretty
        place, but expensive, dreadfully expensive, especially when one has
        the honour of being entertained by the King.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon felt a
        certain pleasure in the high priest’s discomfiture. The new patron
        was more overbearing, less considerate, and generally more difficult
        to get on with than the old. Jason, coxcomb as he was, had always
        been kind, and Cleon felt as kindly for him as it was in his nature
        to feel for any one. And then the exquisite propriety with which this
        disturbing news followed the man’s taunts and boasts was
        irresistible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is hard,”</span> he said, as if to himself,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menelaüs darted an
        angry look at his friend, but the Greek’s face, which he knew how to
        keep under admirable control, expressed nothing but respectful
        sympathy. There was an unpleasant suggestion of mockery in what he
        had heard; but the Greek was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg
        47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        useful person; he had been trusted, too, and knew things which it
        would not do to have published. Altogether, the high priest
        concluded, it would not do to quarrel with him—anyhow, for the
        present; some day, perhaps, he might be got rid of.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I suppose, sir, you cannot make an excuse—important
        affairs of State, the King’s service to be attended to, or something
        of that kind?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon made the
        suggestion, knowing perfectly well that it was quite out of the
        question. But he enjoyed the novel position of tormenting his patron,
        and was taking it out, so to speak, for not a few rudenesses and
        slights.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Excuse!”</span> cried Menelaüs. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It would be as much as my head is worth to do anything
        of the kind. No! I must go. But this is not a journey which one cares
        to take empty-handed. Let me see what I can take—two or three of the
        most portable cups, as much coin as I can scrape together, and the
        jewels—jewels are always useful: it is so easy to hide them. Well, I
        shall leave you in charge; unless, indeed, you are very much set on
        going yourself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon was not at
        all set upon going; on the contrary, nothing short of the strongest
        inducements would have persuaded him to the journey. Going to Antioch
        was like putting one’s head into the lion’s mouth. There was no
        particular reason, indeed, why <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">his</span></span> head should be bitten off; but
        lions are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name=

        sometimes use their teeth for the mere fun of the thing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am much obliged for the chance,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but my health has been suffering lately, and
        I do not feel quite equal to the journey.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, then,”</span> replied Menelaüs, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“stop here, and keep things as straight as you can. And
        if you can sell some of these pretty things for ready money, do
        so—the usual commission for yourself, of course. But it must all be
        kept quiet.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Antioch more than
        deserved the praise of <span class="tei tei-q">“a very pretty
        place,”</span> which Menelaüs had bestowed upon it. In fact, it was
        one of the finest cities of the world. The old town which the first
        Antiochus<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href=
        "#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> had found
        had been improved away by him and his successors. All that could be
        done by a despotic power that made very short work with the wishes
        and even the rights of private owners of property, and by a lavish
        expenditure of money, had been done by five generations of rulers,
        and the result was magnificent. Broad streets ran from side to side;
        and those who grumbled that the narrow alleys of the old town gave at
        least a shelter from the sun were consoled by the rows of planes and
        limes, planted alternately, which shaded both sides of each
        thoroughfare. Rows of houses, which looked more like palaces than
        private dwellings, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg
        50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>occupied the best quarter of the city, and even
        the poorest regions had nothing of the squalor of poverty. Even the
        filth so common in the East was conspicuously absent from Antioch,
        for every gutter ran with an unceasing stream of water, drawn from a
        higher point of the Orontes and carrying into that river at a lower
        point all the defilement of the streets. Temples, in which a whole
        pantheon of gods was worshipped, were to be seen on every hand. The
        pure and harmonious outlines of Greek architecture could be seen side
        by side with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bizarre</span></span> conceptions of Oriental
        art. If the kings and their Greek subjects worshipped Zeus and
        Apollo, and, above all, Aphrodité, who had here her famous grove of
        Daphne, so the Syrian population were faithful to Baal and Ashtaroth.
        A magnificent amphitheatre, capable of holding at least thirty
        thousand spectators, rose, a striking mass of white marble, on the
        north side of the city; a colonnade ran round the four sides of the
        market-place, gorgeous with the lavish colours of the East, for here
        the art of Greece had been superseded for once by the more ornate
        native taste. But the river, rushing down between its noble
        embankments of stone, was the chief ornament of the place. The
        Orontes had not gathered round it the splendid associations that
        clustered about the Tiber, but its broad, clear stream was in
        everything else more than a match for its Italian
        rival.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name=
        "Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menelaüs and his
        companion, who, it may be guessed, had reasons of his own for
        regarding with anxiety the summons that brought him to the capital,
        were not a little relieved to find that the King had been called away
        by urgent affairs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus, one of the
        most important cities in his dominions, had rebelled. Its antiquity,
        its wealth, and its fame as a seat of culture, a character in which
        it claimed to be a rival of Athens itself, had combined to give the
        Tarsians a high opinion of themselves. Successive rulers, beginning
        with the Assyrian kings, its first founders, had allowed the city a
        certain independence; and its pride was grievously wounded when the
        young King, with the reckless levity that distinguished him, handed
        it over as a private possession to his mistress. The citizens pitched
        the lady’s collectors into the Cydnus, shut their gates, and defied
        their sovereign; Mallos, another Cilician city which had suffered the
        same indignity, following their example. The King had marched to
        reduce the rebels—a task, it was probable, of no little
        difficulty—leaving a certain Andronicus to act as his deputy, and
        specially to dispose of the charge on which Menelaüs and Sostratus
        had been summoned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This charge was
        one of a very formidable kind. Menelaüs’s dealings with the treasures
        of the Temple had not been so secret as he had hoped. Such things
        cannot be done without a certain <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>number of confederates, and such confederates
        are very apt to give a finishing touch to their villainy by betraying
        their chief. In this instance one of the journeymen employed had
        considered himself insufficiently paid, rightly thinking, perhaps,
        that if sacrilege can be recompensed at all, it ought to be
        recompensed handsomely. Personally he was too insignificant to
        venture an attack on so great a potentate as the high priest, but he
        knew whither to carry his information. He told what he knew to a
        priest, who, besides being a devout Jew, was a member of the family
        to which the high priesthood properly belonged. The priest, after
        satisfying himself that the story was true, at once set about
        bringing the offender to justice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His course was
        plain. Menelaüs, we have seen, had supplanted Jason, and Jason had
        himself purchased the dignity. But Oniah, the rightful high priest,
        who had been displaced by Jason, was still alive. Antiochus,
        naturally fearing his influence with his countrymen, had kept him at
        his capital, treating him, strange to say, with remarkable
        consideration. But Oniah was one of those men who extort veneration
        even from the most reckless of profligates. His venerable figure, his
        face beaming with benevolence, his blameless life, and the charities
        which he dispensed up to and even beyond the limit of his means, had
        won for him the regard of all Antioch. Even the heathen would stop
        him in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg
        53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>streets and beg his blessing. Oniah was a power
        in Antioch for which even the reckless young profligate on the throne
        had an unfeigned respect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may, then, be
        easily imagined that no little sensation was produced when this
        venerable personage appeared before Antiochus, and, in the presence
        of the Court, accused Menelaüs, whom he had steadfastly refused to
        acknowledge as high priest, of having embezzled much of the treasure
        of the Temple at Jerusalem. That Oniah, whose veracity and good faith
        were beyond all question, should make such a charge was <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">primâ facie</span></span> evidence of its truth.
        As he was known to have many friends in Jerusalem, it was more than
        probable that evidence would be forthcoming. The King did not
        hesitate a moment in acting upon this probability. Of course, he did
        not look at the matter in at all the same light as that in which it
        was regarded by the devout Oniah. To the dispossessed high priest the
        robbery of the sacred vessels was a monstrous sacrilege, an offence
        of the deepest dye, not only against his country but against his God.
        Antiochus felt that it was he who had been wronged. The treasures of
        the Jerusalem Temple were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">his</span></span> treasures. He might be content
        to leave them, at all events for the present, where they were; but
        they must be ready to his hand whenever the occasion should arise,
        and any one who presumed to appropriate them was a traitor and a
        villain. Hence the urgent summons to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Menelaüs and to Sostratus, who, as Governor,
        could hardly fail, thought Antiochus, to have been cognizant of the
        whole proceeding.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost immediately
        after the despatch of the summons came the trouble with Tarsus. The
        King started to chastise in person his rebellious subjects, and left,
        as we have said, Andronicus in general charge of affairs, and with a
        special commission to hear the accusation which Oniah was bringing
        against Menelaüs. The choice was an unlucky one. Antiochus was
        sincerely anxious that justice should be done in the matter; but to
        get justice done in any particular case when it is not the rule of
        the administration is exceedingly difficult. Andronicus, to put the
        facts quite simply, was an unprincipled villain, ready to sell his
        decisions, when he could do so with impunity, to the highest bidder.
        He was an old acquaintance and confederate of Sostratus, and
        Menelaüs, who had established friendly relations with the Governor
        during their journey from Jerusalem to Antioch, soon received a hint
        as to how he should proceed. The hearing of the case had been
        appointed for the sixth day after his arrival. Before that date one
        of the sacred vessels which he had taken the precaution of bringing
        with him, had been exchanged for five hundred gold pieces, and the
        gold pieces had found their way into the pocket of Andronicus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day
        appointed Oniah, supported by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>principal Jewish inhabitants of Antioch and by
        not a few of the most respectable Greeks, appeared to substantiate
        his charges against the usurper Menelaüs. The evidence appeared to be
        overwhelming. The artizan who had been employed to fabricate the
        worthless imitations of the precious vessels told the whole story of
        the fraud with a fulness of detail which seemed to bear all the stamp
        of truth. Another witness related how he had carried one of the
        original articles to a goldsmith at Sidon, and actually produced a
        rough memorandum of its weight, which had been made upon the spot, to
        be afterwards embodied in the formal receipt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The line of
        defence adopted was bold, not to say impudent. The whole affair,
        according to Menelaüs, was a conspiracy on the part of the
        irreconcilable Jews to overthrow a loyal subject of the King. The
        witnesses, he declared, had been suborned, the documents had been
        forged. He then went on to bring a counter-charge against his
        accuser. And here he found a certain advantage in the transparent
        honesty of Oniah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do you acknowledge,”</span> he asked the ex-high priest,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the validity of the appointments which our

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oniah frankly
        confessed that he did not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        the precincts of the Holy City of all such as do not worship the Lord
        God of Israel?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oniah felt that he
        was becoming entangled in this artful web of questions, and made an
        effort to break loose. <span class="tei tei-q">“I appeal,”</span> he
        cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“most excellent Andronicus, to all
        who, in this city of Antioch, for these four years past have known my
        manner of life. You see sundry of them, nor of my own nation only, in
        the court this day. Ask them whether I have not lived in all peace
        and quietness, not seeking to disturb, either by word or deed, the
        dominions of my lord the King.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menelaüs, of
        course, had not come unprovided with witnesses. The old man had, to
        tell the truth, used language of an imprudent kind. He was a patriot
        and a believer. As such, he had his beliefs and his hopes, and it was
        part of his character to express such beliefs and hopes quite openly.
        He had talked of a day when the Holy Land should be no more the prey
        of the alien and the heathen, when a king of the House of David
        should rule in Mount Sion, when the Temple should regain all the
        sacred<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name=
        "Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ness and all the glory
        which had ever belonged to it. Such language, construed strictly, was
        not consistent with a thorough loyalty to the Syrian monarch. But no
        one who knew Oniah, a man of peace who had the good sense to
        recognize what was and what was not possible, could suppose that any
        scheme of revolt against existing authorities had ever entered into
        his mind. In fact he had not said a word that had not been said
        before by one or more of the prophets. Still, words which breathed a
        spirit of independence, when reported by witnesses, and acknowledged
        by Oniah—who was, indeed, too honest to deny them—gave Andronicus the
        occasion for which he had been looking. He gave his decision in the
        following terms:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The charge against Menelaüs is postponed for further
        hearing. Meanwhile the documents produced and the witnesses will
        remain in the custody of the Court. As for Oniah, he must be reserved
        for the judgment of the King in person. I should myself have been
        disposed to release him; but in the absence of my lord, considering
        that the peace of the realm is so essentially concerned, I do not
        venture so far.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was proceeding
        to give orders for the removal of Oniah, when an ominous murmur from
        the audience, with which the court was crowded, made him pause.
        Prisoners who saw the inside of an Antioch dungeon were sometimes not
        heard of again. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg
        58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>air
        had a certain power of developing very rapid diseases, so rapid that
        the sufferers were not only dead but buried before any tidings of the
        sickness reached their friends. Antioch was not disposed to see the
        man who was probably the most widely respected of all its
        inhabitants, exposed to such a risk. Andronicus, who could not even
        trust the soldiers to act against so venerable a person, drew back.
        He was willing, he said, to accept sureties in a sufficient amount
        for the due appearance of the accused. The sureties were forthcoming
        in a moment, in sums so great and so absolutely secure that
        Andronicus had no pretext for refusing them. He proceeded to adjourn
        the Court for fourteen days.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
        interval he took the opportunity of making a change in the garrison
        of the capital. Troops recruited from some of the regions bordering
        on Judæa, and accordingly among the bitterest enemies of its people,
        replaced some Greek mercenaries. The strangers knew nothing about
        Oniah, except that he was a Jew, and, being a Jew, of course hateful.
        They could be relied upon to obey orders, and those who knew
        Andronicus were sure what orders he would issue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oniah’s friends
        urged him to fly. He was too old and feeble, he replied; it would be
        better for him to die at his post. Then they implored him to take
        sanctuary.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg
        59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What!”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“take
        sanctuary in a heathen temple! There is none other in the place. I
        would sooner die a thousand times.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not in a
        temple, they explained, that he was to find shelter. It was in the
        Gardens of Daphne that they wished him to take refuge. And they
        proceeded to unfold an elaborate argument, the gist of which was that
        the Gardens were a civil, and not a religious, sanctuary; that there
        would be no occasion for him to enter the consecrated enclosure; he
        would be simply availing himself of a custom which forbad the
        entrance of the Minister of Justice into a place devoted to the
        amusement of the people. It is probable that they strained their
        argument beyond the limits of the truth. It was with great difficulty
        that Oniah could be made to yield. When he did so at last, on the
        urgent representations of his friends that the hopes of a free Israel
        were largely dependent on the preservation of his life, he could not
        help foreboding that the concession would not profit either himself
        or them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world scarcely
        contained a more beautiful place—beautiful both by grace of nature
        and diligence of art—than the Gardens of Daphne; and certainly none
        that seemed more unlikely to shelter a devout Jew. Its avenues of
        cypress and laurels, its delicious depths of shade, its thousand
        streams, clear as crystal and untouched by the drought of the
        longest, most fiery summer, were but a part of its <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>charms. Of some, perhaps the chief of its
        attractions, it is best not to speak; but there were others, less
        unseemly indeed, but such as must have been absolutely scandalous to
        such a man as Oniah. The curious thronged to see the gigantic statue
        of Apollo, a match both in size and costliness of material to that of
        Zeus in the plain of Olympia. (It was sixty feet in height, and
        wrought of gold and ivory.) To complete the resemblance to the famous
        meeting-place of the Greek race, there was a running ground and rings
        for wrestling and boxing. Finally, Daphne claimed to rival another
        great centre of Greek life in its special characteristic. It was
        stoutly maintained that the Apollo who haunted the laurel-groves of
        Daphne was as true a prophet as he who spoke through the lips of
        Pythia at Delphi. Crowds of men and women, eager to learn the secrets
        of the future, came to the groves of Antioch. The method by which
        they saw into the secrets of fate seemed singularly simple. The
        questioner dipped a laurel leaf into the stream that flowed by the
        shrine, and lo! the surface appeared written over with the
        intimations of fate. Simple it was, but the priests had spent a world
        of pains in acquiring the art of invisible writing, and they did
        their best to learn something about the history and prospects of the
        applicants.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was Daphne,
        and no one could be more astonished than were its inhabitants and
        visitors <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name=
        "Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at the strange figure
        whom they saw before them; strange to the place, indeed, rather than
        to them, for Oniah, as has been said, was one of the best-known
        personages in Antioch. The rumour of his coming had gone before him,
        and a crowd, half curious, half respectful, had gathered to meet him.
        In not a few, indeed, curiosity and respect were mingled with
        something of fear. The presence of this austere piety in this haunt
        of vicious pleasure, was thought to augur ill for its prosperity.
        Some of the priests were heard to murmur that one who was the avowed
        enemy of the gods ought not to be admitted. But they did not venture
        to deny to any one who sought them the privileges of sanctuary, while
        their fears were not of a kind which they could make their followers
        understand. They had, therefore, to acquiesce, and hope that the
        unwelcome visitor would bring with him no ill-luck.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little building,
        as remote as possible from the central temple, had been secured for
        the residence of Oniah. On reaching the gardens he had to make his
        way to it through two dense lines of eager spectators. The temple,
        the shrine of the oracle, the pavilions devoted to pleasure, were for
        the nonce deserted. The drunkards left their wine-cup, and, stranger
        still, the dice-players their gaming-tables, to gaze upon the holy
        man. As he walked up the narrow avenue that had been left for his
        passage, some of the women whose venal beauty was one of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the attractions of the place, threw
        themselves at his feet. Unhappy creatures, they had been brought up
        from childhood to this life of degradation, which indeed had a
        certain hideous sanction of religious association about it; but they
        had not altogether lost the womanly veneration for goodness, and,
        like the Magdalen of a later time, seemed to forget themselves in its
        presence. The old man, unconscious of their character, or perhaps,
        with the Divine Guest of the Pharisee of Capernaum, ignoring it,
        stretched out his hands with the gesture of blessing, and, though it
        was technically a pollution to touch a heathen, he even laid them on
        some children who were almost thrust into his arms. There was hardly
        a heart that was not touched with this kindness, and when the priest,
        as he entered his new abode, turned and bade the multitude farewell,
        he was answered with shouts of enthusiasm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menelaüs and his
        accomplices were dismayed at the escape of the victim. A witness who
        knew so much, and whose word was so implicitly believed, must be
        silenced at any cost. To take him by force from the sanctuary was
        impossible. Any attempt of the kind would certainly end in disaster.
        But it might be possible to draw him forth by fraud. Menelaüs knew
        enough of the old man’s character to be sure that he had gone
        reluctantly, and would gladly seize the opportunity of quitting a
        scene in which he must have felt himself so much out of place. Some
        such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name=
        "Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fraud it would not be
        difficult to contrive with the help of Andronicus. Accordingly
        another of the sacred vessels found its way to the dealer, and
        another purse of gold into the pocket of the viceroy, and in a few
        hours the plot was arranged. As Antiochus was on his way back from
        the north, there was no time to be lost.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days after the
        arrival of Oniah at the gardens a visitor to him was announced. It
        was the viceroy himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Venerable sir,”</span> he began, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it has grieved me beyond measure to find that you were
        distrustful of my honourable, and I may say friendly, intentions
        concerning you. Whoever accused me of ill-will towards you has
        wronged me most foully. And let me add that you also have been
        wronged no less in that you have been persuaded to come to a place so
        unworthy of your dignity. Your safety should be ensured, not by a
        sanctuary in which thieves and murderers find refuge, but by the
        inviolable precincts of the royal palace itself. Let me offer to you,
        in the name of the King, the hospitality of his abode. In the
        meanwhile I am willing to swear by any oaths that may suffice to
        satisfy you and your friends, that you shall suffer no injury from my
        hands.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One or two of
        Oniah’s friends strongly dissuaded him from trusting himself to the
        viceroy. But their caution was overborne by their companions and by
        the eagerness of the priest to quit so uncongenial a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>place. Andronicus took every oath known to
        Greek or Jew that he would treat the priest with all respect, and
        Oniah gladly bade farewell to the Gardens. His departure was made at
        the dead of night, and unknown to any of the inhabitants of Daphne.
        Had they been aware of his intention, it is probable, knowing as they
        did the character of Andronicus, that they would have hindered it by
        force.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost at the
        moment of Oniah’s arrival at the palace a runner reached it from the
        King announcing his intended arrival on the next day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Speedy action was
        necessary, and Andronicus, though not without misgivings, determined
        to lose no time. A Court of Justice, so called, was hastily held. A
        creature of his own was called to preside over it. Witnesses whose
        testimony had been carefully prepared, deposed to preparations for
        rebellion to which Oniah had been privy, and to which he had lent his
        aid. The accused was not allowed to have an advocate, and scarcely
        even permitted to speak. Two hours sufficed for this mockery of a
        legal process, and two more for carrying into effect the sentence of
        death which was of course pronounced. Though the brutal Cilicians who
        formed the garrison of the palace were ready to carry out any order
        which their officer might give, it was judged well to avoid anything
        like a public execution. That very night Oniah was poisoned in his
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065"
        id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prison, and before dawn the
        next day his body was hastily consigned to the tomb.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The punishment for
        this atrocious act of treachery and cruelty was not long delayed. One
        of the first acts of Antiochus, after his return to his capital, was
        to demand the presence of Oniah, and then the story had to be told.
        Andronicus did his best to put such a colour upon it as would deceive
        his master. The attempt was vain. The King saw in a moment through
        the idle charges which had been brought against the dead man.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What!”</span> he cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oniah rebel against <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></span>!”</span>
        His vanity and self-confidence made the accusation seem the very
        height of absurdity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course,”</span> the King went on—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“of course he did not acknowledge the priesthood of Jason
        or Menelaüs; he has told me so himself twenty times. He could not
        think otherwise, and he was as honest as the day. I only wish that he
        had left another as honest behind him. Zeus and all the gods of
        heaven and hell confound me if I do not avenge him to the uttermost.
        Tell me,”</span> he cried, turning to the captain of the Cilicians,
        who stood by dismayed at his master’s rage—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“tell me where you have buried him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The captain
        described the place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will see him once more, and these villains shall see
        him too,”</span> he said, pointing to the trembling pair, Andronicus
        and his creature the judge.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He went on foot,
        his royal dress discarded for a mourner’s cloak. His courtiers
        followed him, and a guard of soldiers behind brought with them the
        guilty viceroy and judge.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Open the grave,”</span> he said, when he reached the
        spot.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was soon done,
        for the murderers had hurried their victim into a shallow tomb. In a
        few minutes the body of the dead man was exposed to view. Decay had
        not commenced, and death had given fresh depth and beauty to the
        serenity which had been their habitual expression in life. Antiochus
        gazed awhile at the face; then, dropping on his knees, covered his
        head with his mantle, and burst into a passion of tears.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a few minutes
        he rose to his feet. Grief had given place to rage, and his eyes
        blazed with fury.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Bind that wretch!”</span> he cried, pointing to the
        wretched Andronicus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was bound, and
        stood waiting his doom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is not worth the blow of an honest sword,”</span>
        cried the King; <span class="tei tei-q">“strangle him, as if he were
        a dog. But first make him look at the man whom he has
        murdered.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Andronicus was
        forced to the edge of the grave and compelled to look at the dead. A
        halter was thrown round his neck, and the next moment he was a
        corpse. The judge shared his fate. <span class="tei tei-q">“And you,
        sir,”</span> said the King, turning to the captain who <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had administered the poison—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you, sir, though you are a barbarian, and know no
        better, must learn that you cannot rob the world of one who was worth
        a thousand such brutes as you. You are captain no more; that is your
        successor,”</span> and he pointed to an officer in his train.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“You can groom his horses, if you don’t want
        to starve. And think that you are lucky that you keep your

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A year has passed
        since the tragedy related in the last chapter. Menelaüs, thanks
        chiefly to the fickle temper of Antiochus, had escaped the fate which
        overtook his accomplice Andronicus, and had returned to pillage his
        unfortunate countrymen in Palestine. But his lease of power had come
        to an end. Jason, his dispossessed rival, had taken the opportunity
        of a report that Antiochus was dead, and attacked him. There could
        hardly be any choice between the two men. Both were equally
        rapacious; equally unfaithful to their religion and their country.
        But Jason had been out of power for two years, and his misdeeds had
        faded a little from the memory of the people; Menelaüs’s enormities
        were still fresh in their recollection. After a sharp conflict, the
        losses of which were utterly out of proportion to any gain that could
        possibly come from it, Jason had won the day, and his rival had
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069"
        id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>been compelled to take refuge
        in the Castle. Then came the news that the report of the death of
        Antiochus was false. He had settled affairs in Egypt after his
        liking, and was now on his way northwards, furious at the trouble
        which this obstinate province was giving him, and resolved, as he
        said, to quiet it for good. Jason had fled in headlong haste, and his
        partisans, and, indeed, most of those who had the means to go, had
        followed his example. Meanwhile Jerusalem was awaiting the future
        with fear and trembling.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is an evening
        in the early summer, and the western wall of the city is crowded with
        men and women, who are gazing with awe-stricken faces on the strange
        appearance of the sunset. All day people had been talking of the
        marvellous shapes which had appeared the evening before in the
        western sky, and now a great multitude had assembled to see whether
        the marvel would be repeated, and, if so, to judge of it for
        themselves. Nor had they assembled in vain. Never, within the memory
        of man, had the heavens worn a stranger, a more terrifying look.
        Above the spot where the sun was just sinking to his rest the whole
        sky glowed with a red and angry light. On this background, so to
        speak, the clouds of a lower stratum had shaped themselves into the
        forms of two armies ready to engage in battle. The spectators seemed
        to be able to trace in one place the serried ranks of infantry, in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070"
        id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>another the massed array of
        chariots and horses. A space, brilliantly coloured, as it might seem,
        with something like the hue of blood, intervened between the two airy
        hosts. But these seemed to be slowly nearing each other, and the
        gazing people watched the lessening space, expecting, one might
        think, to hear the actual clash of arms when they should have met.
        But then the sun set, and with the sudden failing of light that marks
        the evening of more southern climes than ours, the whole pageant
        vanished from before the eyes of the spectators.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the crowd is
        our old acquaintance Menander, or Micah, whom we last met in the
        library of Jason. Things have not gone well with him since then. He
        had cherished a belief that Greek culture, the brightness of Greek
        literature and art, would do something to amend the severity, and
        what he was pleased to call the tastelessness of Jewish life. To a
        certain extent it had been an honest belief, though the
        pleasure-loving nature of the man, in its revolt against the stern
        morality of the Law, had had something to do with developing it. But
        his experience of Greek culture and its works had not been
        encouraging. If the reforming doctrine had to be preached by such
        prophets as Jason, and Menelaüs, and the cruel and profligate young
        tyrant Antiochus, it was more than doubtful whether it would do any
        good. Hitherto, certainly, it had done no good at all. The people
        were more unhappy, more spirit<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>less, more like slaves than they had ever been
        before; the rulers were more greedy and selfish, more absolutely
        careless of all that did not concern their own interests. Might he
        not, he began to think to himself, have made a mistake? Might not the
        old life, which was at least the life of free men, be better than the
        new?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was busy with
        such thoughts when he heard a woman’s voice behind him whisper
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Micah.”</span> He did not recognize it at
        once, but its tones were familiar to him, and they seemed to touch
        the same chord in his heart with which his thoughts were then busy.
        And the name, the old Hebrew name, that too was familiar, though it
        was long since he had heard it. He was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Menander”</span> to his friends; for his friends were
        either Greeks, or else Jews who, like himself, had cast off the
        associations of his birth and race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Micah,”</span> said the voice again, and he turned to
        look at the speaker.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was a woman of
        some thirty years, plainly, almost poorly, dressed, but with all the
        air of gentle birth and breeding. Her face was beautiful, not with
        the brilliant loveliness of youth, but with that which is brought
        into the features by a pure and tender soul. There were the lines of
        many sorrows and cares upon her forehead, and round her eyes, and in
        the corners of mouth and cheek; but her eyes, save that they seemed
        almost too large for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg
        72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>thinner contours of the face, were as beautiful
        as they had been in the first glory of her youth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was Hannah, his
        elder sister, who had been as a mother to him in his orphaned
        childhood, that Menander recognized. Years had passed since they met.
        There had been no quarrel, but circumstances had made a barrier
        between them. What Menander’s life had been we know, and Hannah was
        the wife of a faithful and devout Jew, Azariah by name, who, though
        still cherishing kindly thoughts for his young kinsman, had felt
        that, for the present at least, they were best apart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Brother and sister
        eagerly clasped hands, and Menander, or Micah, as we will call him,
        felt a lump rise in his own throat as he saw the tearful smile in
        Hannah’s lustrous eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Micah,”</span> she said—<span class="tei tei-q">“for you
        will not mind my calling you Micah, though I hear you use another
        name; but you were always Micah to me—this is a strange sight on
        which we have been looking.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, sister,”</span> he answered, with a gaiety of tone
        which was more than half assumed—<span class="tei tei-q">“yes,
        sister, strange enough; but then we know that the clouds do take
        strange shapes at times. A current of air blows them this way or
        that, and, with our fancy to help, they become anything in heaven or
        earth that we may fancy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, Micah, there is more than fancy here. You and I
        used to watch the clouds from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>window in the old house, and to laugh at the odd
        shapes which we found in them—lions, and dogs, and whales, and such
        things—but we never saw such a sight as this.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But we had not in those days such thoughts of our own to
        read into the sights of the skies. But tell me, Hannah, what do you
        think it means?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What can it mean,”</span> she answered, in a low voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“but wrath—wrath upon us and upon our
        children?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wrath, perhaps,”</span> he cried; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and the sky has, I must confess, an angry look. But why
        must it be upon us? Why not rather upon our enemies? I see nothing in
        the skies which tells us whether these sights be meant for us or for
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, my brother, speak not thus, for you know better in
        your heart. The heavens give us these signs, or rather God gives them
        to us through the heavens, but He leaves it to our own hearts to
        interpret them. They tell us surely enough on whom this wrath must
        fall.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But, sister, tell me why on us? Are we worse than our
        neighbours—than these robbers of Edomites and Ammonites, these sullen
        Romans, never satisfied except when they are fighting—these mongrel
        Syrians?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They are heathen,”</span> said Hannah, in a solemn
        voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“and they do not sin against light.
        Let us leave them to the judgment of God. But ourselves <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we can judge. Look at this city; we call
        it the City of David—but where is the spirit of David? Have we not
        trampled the Law underfoot, making to ourselves graven images of
        things in heaven and earth and the water under the earth? Where is
        the honour of the Sabbath? Where is the morning and evening
        sacrifice? Where are the yearly feasts? Will our God deliver us
        again, when we will not thank Him for the deliverances that He hath
        wrought already? Oh, Micah, I do not seek to anger you; but are you
        such as our father, now in Abraham’s bosom, would rejoice to see you?
        And tell me, how was it that we Hebrews became a great people? A
        Syrian ready to perish was our father, and lo! before a thousand
        years were past, Solomon reigned from the great river to the Western
        sea. How came we by this might? Was it by aping Egyptian or Greek?
        Did we not keep to our own way, and walk after our own law, and
        worship our own God? Then it was well with us, and the nations round
        about feared us and honoured us; but now they laugh us to scorn, for
        we are ashamed of our own selves, and seek to be what they are, and
        cannot attain to it, and so fall short both of their greatness and of
        ours.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah stood dumb
        before this fierce torrent of words. Was this the gentle Hannah of
        his youth? There must be some mighty influence that could change the
        lamb into the lioness.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She went on, in a
        gentler voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“You are not angry with me,
        brother?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I must go, for my husband will be waiting for the
        evening meal. Come, children,”</span> she went on, speaking to two
        little girls who had been clinging to their mother’s cloak, gazing
        open-eyed and half-terrified at this strange kinsman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And are these my nieces?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes; Miriam and Judith,”</span> answered Hannah,
        pointing first to one and then to the other. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This, children, is your dear uncle, Micah.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man
        stooped and kissed the children.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You will not let it be so long before we see you
        again?”</span> said Hannah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His answer was to
        wring her hand, and turn away. Her words had pricked him to the
        heart, and he did not know whether to thank her or be angry.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must now turn
        to another group which had also been drawn to the walls by the report
        of the marvellous sights that were to be seen in the heavens. A group
        it was that would have attracted attention anywhere, so remarkable
        were the contrasts and the resemblances which it presented.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principal
        figure was an old man dressed in the everyday garb of a priest. The
        burden of years had bowed his stately figure, for he had long since
        passed the limit which the Psalmist assigns to the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>life of man, but his eye was as brilliant
        as ever, and his voice, when he spoke, had lost none of its depth and
        fulness of tone. His three companions were men in the vigour of life.
        All surpassed the common stature, but yet none of them equalled the
        height of their father, for that they were father and sons the most
        casual observer must have seen. In age there was little difference
        between them. The eldest may have numbered about forty years, the
        youngest, perhaps, four less. Their dress was mainly that of the
        middle-class Jew, and so different from the old man’s priestly garb,
        but not without some distinctive marks that indicated the fact that
        they belonged to the House of Aaron. The multitude of priests was
        indeed so great that but a very small share in the services of the
        Temple, even when these were fully carried out, fell to the lot of
        any one man. These services had now been reduced to a minimum, and
        numbers of the priestly houses, while not repudiating their
        hereditary office, practically devoted themselves to the ordinary
        avocations of life. This had been done by the three sons of
        Mattathias of Modin, for such was the name and such the ancestral
        city of the aged priest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Judas,”</span> said the old man, addressing one of his
        sons, <span class="tei tei-q">“these signs in the heavens are of a
        surety from the Lord.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The son addressed
        was the youngest of the three; but it was evident from the bearing of
        his brothers, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg
        77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        from the air of respect and attention with which they waited for him
        to speak, that they were accustomed to see him the first recipient of
        their father’s confidence. And indeed it was not difficult to see,
        under a superficial resemblance of figure and face, something that
        distinguished him from his companions. John, the eldest, was a plain,
        blunt soldier, raised above the average level of his profession, by
        the purity of his life and the depth of his religious convictions,
        but still essentially a soldier, one who saw no way of solving
        complicated questions save by a downright blow of the sword. Simon,
        the second in point of age, had a singularly mild and benevolent
        expression, though his eyes were full of intelligence and the lines
        of his mouth and chin seemed to show that he could be firm on
        occasion. But Judas had all the outward characteristics of a hero. A
        sturdier soldier never wielded sword, but he saw that there are
        difficulties to which the sword alone can bring no solution. Nor was
        he slow to follow all the subtleties of diplomacy; but, at the same
        time, he never lost his grasp of the principles which all the skill
        of the diplomatist is unable to change.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> he now said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that these signs are from the Lord I do not doubt. But
        what is your counsel?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Speak you first, my son,”</span> replied the old man;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“’tis ever best so. You might be unwilling to
        differ from me and yet be in the right. This at least my <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>years have taught me—that it is easy for
        any man to err.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us stay,”</span> said Judas. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis true the air is stifling, such as a free man can
        scarcely bear to breathe. But there are many, father, that look to
        you for counsel and guidance, and we may scarcely leave them, at
        least till the call sounds more plainly in our ears.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> cried John, the soldier, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am not, as you know, one that would readily give his
        vote for flight. But here we are, methinks, as rats in a hole. May we
        not lawfully, and with good faith to God and our brethren, seek some
        place where we may at least have space to draw our swords and strike
        a blow?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And you, Simon, what say you?”</span> asked the old man,
        turning to his second son.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God knows that I would give much to be back at home. But
        our brethren need us here, and we may give them some comfort. Let us
        stay.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Judas and Simon,”</span> said the old man, after a
        pause, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have spoken well, and I give my
        voice with yours. As yet our duty seems to keep us here. When it
        shall call us hence, we will follow it. And you, John, think not that
        you will long want for an occasion to strike with the sword. It shall
        come; but you will be readier for it if you make no haste to meet
        it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this the
        little party turned away from the wall, and made their way to their

        "font-size: 100%">THE EVIL DAYS.</span></span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long
        before the portent which the terrified crowd had watched from the
        walls of Jerusalem found, or at least began to find, its fulfilment,
        for, indeed, many days were to pass before the wretched people had
        drained the cup of suffering to the dregs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First there was
        the actual arrival of the army, the rumour of whose approach had
        struck such terror into Jason. At its head came Antiochus in person,
        fresh from his successful campaigns in Egypt and in his train
        followed the renegade Menelaüs with a crowd of unscrupulous and
        profligate adventurers. There was no attempt at resistance. The gates
        were thrown open by the King’s adherents in the city. But if the
        citizens had hoped to soften the tyrant’s heart by their submissive
        attitude they were miserably disappointed. For days the streets of
        the city ran red with blood. The prominent members of the patriotic
        party were the first to perish. Then <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>came all the private enemies of the returning
        renegades; and then a far greater multitude who were singled out for
        destruction by the possession of anything that excited the cupidity
        of the conquerors. Lastly, as ever happens at such times, the
        massacre that is suggested by hatred or greed was followed by the
        massacre that is the result of the merest wantonness. But there were
        victims more unhappy than those who thus perished by the sword of the
        heathen. The money found on the persons and in the houses of the
        victims did not satisfy the cupidity of their murderers. There were
        thousands who had indeed nothing of their own to lose, but who were
        in themselves a valuable property. These were sent off in droves to
        be sold, till the slave-markets of the Eastern Mediterranean were
        glutted with the Jewish youth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still worse in the
        eyes of all pious Jews than the massacre or the captivity was the
        profanation of the Temple. The innermost shrine, the Holy of Holies,
        which the high priest himself was permitted by the Law to enter but
        once only in the year, was thrown open to the unhallowed gaze of a
        debauched heathen. With a horror that passes description the people
        saw the renegade Menelaüs, bound to be the guardian of the sanctity
        of the place, actually drawing aside the veil with his own hand, and
        conducting the King into the awful enclosure. They saw the most
        sacred treasures, gifts of the piety of many <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>generations, treasures to which the revenue of
        the Persian kings, and even of the victorious Alexander himself had
        contributed, become the spoil of the sacrilegious intruders. The
        golden altar of incense and the table of the shew-bread were taken by
        the King, while the seven-branched candlestick of gold fell, as was
        commonly believed, to the high priest himself. They saw it, and it
        almost overturned their faith that no visible sign of the Divine
        wrath followed an impiety so terrible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Antiochus came
        and went, leaving behind him as his deputy, Philip, the Phrygian,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in manners more barbarous than he who set
        him there.”</span> The time that followed was one of grievous
        depression and sadness. Life went on, as it will even amidst the
        gloomiest circumstances, but all the joy and brightness were crushed
        out of it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah’s sister,
        the Hannah whom we have seen talking to him on the wall, gave birth
        to a son shortly after the departure of Antiochus. No feast was held
        on occasion of the rite that made the little one a member of the
        family of Abraham. When the forty days of purification were past, the
        mother was not taken to present her offspring in the Temple. The
        Temple, the haunt of pagans and apostates, was no place for faithful
        sons and daughters of Abraham. A visit to its courts could hardly be
        the seal of purification when it needed purifying so sorely
        itself.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg
        82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An occasion that
        should by right have been still more joyful was allowed to pass with
        the absence of festivity. A younger sister of Hannah, Ruth by name,
        had long before been promised to Seraiah, a friend and relative of
        her husband. Time after time the marriage had been postponed, under
        the pressure of evil times; and when at last it was performed, not
        even then without sore misgivings and anticipations of evil among all
        the elders of the family, the celebration was of the quietest kind.
        Not a guest beyond the few friends who attended on the bridegroom was
        invited; and it was in dead silence, not with the usual shouts of
        merriment and gay procession of torches, that the bride was taken to
        her husband’s home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet, as we
        shall see, even for these evils there was a compensating good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah, though he
        had affected to make light of the foreboding of evil which he had
        heard from his sister, had really been impressed by it—so much
        impressed, indeed, that he had left the city for a little country
        house at the northern end of the Lake of Galilee, that belonged to
        him. He had invited his relatives to accompany him, but they had
        declined. Their place, they said, was at home, among their poorer
        brethren, where they might do something to help and strengthen. All
        that Micah could do was to commend them to the protection of the
        Greek party in the city, with whom, in spite of his <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fast increasing disgust at their
        proceedings, he had not yet broken.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had now
        returned, and he lost no time in finding his way to his sister’s
        house. The ravages made by fire and sword were only too plainly
        visible as he walked along. Houses that he had known from his
        childhood, in which he had often been a guest, were now but blackened
        walls; others were shapeless ruins. Again and again he saw on
        fragments of stone and plaster hideous blotches which he knew to be
        of blood; and as he saw these things he cursed aloud the hands which
        had wrought these horrors, not without the bitterest self-reproach
        that his own hand might have grasped them in friendship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a great
        relief to find that his sister’s house had been spared any outrage.
        But when he demanded admittance in the usual way, by kicking the
        door, it became evident that there had been a reign of terror, and
        that the inmates of the dwelling were not sure that it was yet over.
        The door was not thrown open in the usual free fashion of Jewish
        hospitality, but he became aware by a slight movement of one of the
        closed lattices that he was being inspected from above. The
        inspection was apparently satisfactory, for in another minute there
        was a sound of undrawing bolts and unfastening chains, and the
        inhospitable door was at last open. Hannah, sadly aged in look her
        brother thought, met him in the hall, and greeted him with a silent
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084"
        id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>embrace. After a pause, in
        which she seemed to be struggling with her tears, she said—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Welcome, dear Micah; while you and my husband and my
        children are left to me I feel that I cannot be unhappy. And perhaps
        you,”</span> she added, with a wistful look in his face, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“will draw nearer to us now. But come and see my dear
        ones.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She led the way to
        a room at the back of the house, looking out into a little garden
        shaded by a wide-branching fig-tree. Hannah noiselessly drew aside
        the curtain that served for a door, and the two stood by common
        consent and watched the scene that met their eyes. Azariah, the
        father of the family, was sitting with his back turned to them,
        holding on his knees a copy of the Law. On two stools at his feet sat
        his daughters, each holding in one hand a tablet covered with wax,
        and in the other a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">stylus</span></span> or
        sharp-pointed iron pen. He was slowly dictating to them the words,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one
        Lord,”</span> and the little creatures were laboriously forming, not
        without many pauses for thought, the scarcely familiar letters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now read it, my children,”</span> said Azariah, when the
        task was finished; and one after another the sweet, childish voices
        repeated the well-known words. Micah, as he listened, felt himself
        strangely touched. Presently he heard his sister murmur to herself,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“In Thy Law will I meditate day and
        night,”</span> and glancing at her face saw it illumined <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with a joy which he could scarcely have
        believed those wasted features capable of expressing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis well, Miriam; ’tis well, Judith,”</span> said
        Azariah to the little girls, and putting his hands upon their heads,
        as they stood before him, for they had risen to repeat the holy
        words, he repeated, <span class="tei tei-q">“The God of Abraham and
        Sarah bless you.”</span> And then, for they were mere children after
        all, and not above childish rewards, gave each a ripe fig from a
        basket which stood on a table by his side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lesson being
        over, Hannah advanced, and her brother followed. Azariah turned and
        greeted the new comer not unkindly, but with a certain reserve, for
        he could not forget that his visitor was a Menander as well as a
        Micah, and that he had been the friend of the traitorous Jason, and
        the yet more traitorous Menelaüs. The children, after their first
        feeling of alarm, for a strange face was seldom seen in that home,
        and when Miriam, the elder, had recognized her uncle, showed no
        reserve in their welcome. They clung about his neck, and kissed him.
        They insisted on his coming to see their pets—Miriam’s turtle-doves,
        and Judith’s dormice, and the little gazelle fawn which they owned in
        common. <span class="tei tei-q">“They have not heard a word against
        me,”</span> thought Micah to himself; and this affectionate loyalty
        touched him to the heart. From his sister he might, perhaps, have
        expected it, but that the stern Azariah, a narrow-minded bigot,
        without a kindly thought for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg
        86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>any
        that did not walk in his way, as he had been accustomed to think of
        him—that Azariah himself should have dealt with him so mercifully,
        was a surprise as it was also a reproach.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stopped with
        them for the rest of the day, and after the evening meal, when the
        little ones had gone to bed, after making their uncle promise that he
        would soon come and see them again, the three had much serious talk
        together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah had, of
        course, the family history to hear, for, stranger as he had been to
        them for some years past, he knew scarcely anything about it. He
        learnt now for the first time that a little boy had been born who,
        had he lived, would have been about two years younger than Judith.
        The mother had much to say about his beauty and goodness, and his
        rare promise of intelligence. Micah was touched all the more because
        he could not forgive himself for the alienation which had prevented
        him from saying a word of comfort to his sister in the hour of her
        bereavement. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was, indeed, a terrible
        loss,”</span> and he rose from his seat and kissed her. He felt that
        this little proof of his love would be better than many words.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> she said, with a cheerfulness that almost
        startled him—<span class="tei tei-q">“nay; you must not say that we
        have lost our dear little Joshua. I know that I have a son still,
        though he is not here. I confess that it was very hard to part with
        him. But he is quite <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg
        87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>safe
        in Abraham’s bosom, safer and better off,”</span> she added, with a
        sad smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“than he would be here; and some
        day I shall see him, and show him to you, dear Micah, and we shall be
        happy together.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this the
        little party had much talk about the state of things in the present,
        and the prospects of the future. Again Micah was astonished to see
        the cheerfulness and courage which his sister and her husband kept up
        in the midst of circumstances which must have been most
        disheartening.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said Azariah, when the conversation turned
        upon the desolation of the Temple, and the loss of all the ceremonial
        of worship, the daily sacrifice, and the great festivals of the
        year—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! there are consolations even here.
        Perhaps we thought too much of these things in the old time. We were
        taken up with the outside, with the show and the splendour, the
        vessels of gold, and the clouds of incense smoke as they curled about
        the pillars and the roof, and we forgot what they meant. But now that
        the outside things are taken from us, we can give our hearts to that
        which is within. We have our gatherings still, though the Temple
        doors are shut. Every Sabbath-day we meet, and the Law and the
        Prophets are read in our ears—aye, and there are those who can
        expound them, and speak words that comfort and strengthen us. I,
        myself, have felt the Spirit move me once or twice to exhort and
        cheer the brethren. No, brother! believe me, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>it is not wholly loss that we cannot assemble
        any more in our beautiful house. Our fathers learnt much when they
        sat mourning by the waters of Babylon, and we also are learning much
        in this our second captivity.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sounded
        strange to the young man, who, indeed, had dulled his understanding
        of spiritual things by his follies and excesses. Still he could not
        help feeling deeply impressed by the evident earnestness of the
        speaker. But he felt that he could say nothing. A trifler and
        unbeliever like himself could only remain silent in the presence of
        thoughts and feelings so much higher than anything to which he could
        reach.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a short
        pause Azariah went on—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord has not seen
        fit to renew among us the spirit of prophecy, and we know not
        certainly of the things that are coming upon the earth. Yet a man,
        though he be no prophet, may read the signs of the times. Believe me,
        there are days to come more full of evil and darkness even than those
        that we have seen. My heart sometimes fails me when I think of this
        dear woman,”</span> and as he spoke he laid his hand upon his wife’s
        shoulder, <span class="tei tei-q">“and of the little ones whom God

        Micah took his leave. As he walked through the deserted streets he

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah had read
        the signs of the times aright. The darker days had come, days so full
        of trouble that the unhappy people looked back to the past that had
        seemed so sad and gloomy as to a time of rest. Things had not been
        going well with King Antiochus, for the Romans had driven him out of
        Egypt, and in his rage and fear he turned against his Jewish subjects
        with greater ferocity than ever. One of his motives was the brutal
        desire to wreak upon the feeble the vengeance which he could not
        exact from the strong; the other was a genuine fear lest he should
        lose another province as he had already lost Egypt. He saw that the
        policy of Rome was to stir up against him the national spirit of
        subject peoples, and he knew well enough that in the Jews, crushed
        though they had been by oppression and massacre, this national spirit
        was not by any means dead. Accordingly he set himself with relentless
        ferocity to extinguish it. Everything distinctive <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the people was to be rooted out; that
        done they might become really submissive; there would be no more a
        land of the Jews, but simply a province of Southern Syria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first thing,
        he conceived, would be to strike such terror into the hearts of the
        people that there should be no thought among them of resistance. For
        such a purpose nothing could be more effective than another massacre
        such as that which had already been perpetrated two years before
        under his own eyes: only this, he determined, should be more
        complete. He perceived with a devilish ingenuity that his orders
        would be more relentlessly carried out if he entrusted their
        execution to some one else, than if he were personally present.
        Appeals might be made to him to which he might yield out of sheer
        weariness, whereas a lieutenant, if he were only hard-hearted enough,
        would simply fall back upon the orders which he had received, and
        refuse all responsibility save that of seeing that these were fully
        carried out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a lieutenant
        he knew that he possessed in the person of a certain Apollonius, a
        Cretan mercenary, who had already given proofs enough that he was
        about as little troubled as any man could be with a conscience or
        with feelings of compassion. To Apollonius, accordingly, the
        commission was entrusted, and he proceeded to execute it in a
        particularly brutal and treacherous way.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He marched to
        Jerusalem, taking with him a picked force of some five thousand
        men—picked, it may be said, quite as much for their unscrupulous and
        ferocious character, as for their strength and skill in arms. There
        would have been, in any case, little chance of resistance, but, to
        make his task the easier of accomplishment, he had so timed his
        coming that he approached the city two or three hours before the end
        of the Sabbath. Secret orders had been sent to Philip, the Phrygian,
        that he was to relax the severity of his rule; and the people had
        begun to breathe again after a long period of repression. The Temple
        was still shut, or virtually shut, but the synagogues were open, and
        were indeed frequented by throngs of fervent worshippers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It wanted a couple
        of hours to sunset when the news ran through the city that an armed
        force was approaching the walls. The first feeling aroused by the
        tidings was naturally one of alarm. The appearance of the soldiers,
        however, was such as to disarm all apprehensions. In the first place
        they were more like a crowd of men who happened to be carrying arms
        than an army. They were not marching in ranks, or indeed keeping any
        kind of order. A multitude of country-folk could be seen mingled
        among them, soldiers and civilians walking side by side in the most
        friendly and unconstrained fashion. Some of the new comers recognized
        old acquaintances among the townsfolk, and introduced their
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg093"
        id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>comrades to them; and though
        some of the sterner sort stood rigidly aloof, there were quite enough
        among the inhabitants of Jerusalem to give the visitors a general
        welcome. Apollonius himself, a conspicuous figure as he rode on his
        white charger up and down the streets of the city, was noticeably
        busy in renewing old acquaintanceships and making new ones.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And then in a
        moment the whole scene was changed. A soldier and a citizen were
        standing on the wall, talking and laughing together, and that in a
        place where they could be seen by all observers. Suddenly, without
        there having been even the slightest sign of a quarrel, the soldier
        was seen to plunge his sword into the side of his companion. It was a
        preconcerted signal. The wretched inhabitants, who would have been
        defenceless in any case, were taken absolutely off their guard, and
        had but slender chances of escape. How many hundreds, possibly
        thousands, perished cannot be guessed. But the massacre was more
        general, more pitiless than that which had devastated the city two
        years before. Apollonius’s <span class="tei tei-q">“picked”</span>
        men showed themselves altogether worthy of his choice, so brutal and
        bloodthirsty were they. And Apollonius himself was to be seen
        everywhere urging his men to make short work with these <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“pestilent Jews,”</span> as he called them, and not
        unfrequently striking a blow himself. He earned on that day such
        hatred that thereafter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg
        94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there
        was not to be found a Jew, save among the vilest renegades and
        traitors, but uttered a curse when his name was mentioned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course the
        soldiers had to be paid for their bloody day’s work, and they were
        paid by the plunder of the city. The houses were stripped, and the
        plunderers, when they had carried away everything that had roused
        their cupidity, often, out of sheer wantonness, completed the work of
        devastation, by setting fire to the desolated houses. Altogether
        Jerusalem presented such a spectacle as had not been seen since the
        days of the Babylonian conquest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spirit of the
        people having been, as it would seem, thus effectually broken for the
        present, it remained to provide against its possible revival in the
        future.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Long gaps were
        made in the line of wall, so long that it took not a few days to make
        them, and would certainly require as many weeks to repair. The town
        thus made defenceless was further overawed by the erection of a fort
        in the City of David, this fort being held by a strong garrison of
        Greeks and Asiatic mercenaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The means of
        repression thus provided, the next thing was to extinguish all that
        was characteristic of the national life. First, the great centre of
        that life, the Temple, was formally desecrated. Already it had been
        subjected to such indignities that the pious Jew could scarcely bear
        to enter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name=
        "Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>its precincts. But the
        final horror, the <span class="tei tei-q">“abomination of
        desolation,”</span> was yet to come. On the 15th of the month Chisleu
        (December) an altar of a Greek pattern, and consecrated to the
        Olympian Zeus, was placed on the great altar of sacrifice, and ten
        days afterwards a huge sow was slaughtered on this. Her blood, caught
        after the Greek fashion in a bowl, was sprinkled on the altar of
        incense and on the mercy-seat within the Holy of Holies—a hideous
        mockery of the sprinkling which the Law enjoined to be performed once
        in every year. From the animal’s flesh a mess of broth was prepared,
        and this was sprinkled on the copies of the Law. The Temple, thus
        dishonoured, was as if it had ceased to be.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        meeting-houses, in which, as we have seen, the people had found a
        substitute for the Temple worship, were summarily closed. An edict
        was issued commanding that every one who possessed a copy of the Law,
        or of any one of the sacred books, should give it up without loss of
        time. To call in cupidity to the aid of fear in enforcing this edict,
        the King’s officers were instructed to pay a reasonable price for the
        manuscripts thus produced. It was made a capital offence to read or
        to recite any part of the proscribed writings. Then the practice of
        circumcision was forbidden. Death was to be the penalty for all who
        should take any part in performing this rite—for the circumciser, the
        mother, the father, even the babe itself.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And then to the
        policy of repression Antiochus added the policy of bribery and
        temptation. Their own worship forbidden, the Jews were to be allured
        by the seductions of the worship of their masters. Hitherto little
        had been done in this way. Insults indeed, had been heaped upon the
        people; but little attempt had been made to attract them. The Temple
        gates, closed for more than a year, were again thrown open; and the
        courts, long silent, resounded with the mirth of sacrificial banquets
        and the gaiety of festivals. Not only all the splendours, but all the
        impure pleasures of heathen worship were called in to assist the
        attempt that was being made to sap what was left of the faith of the
        people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Antiochus, who,
        for all his wrath at Jewish obstinacy, could not help feeling a
        certain respect for it, took the trouble to send among the people a
        missionary, if he may be so called, who was to instruct them in the
        new religion which their King was so anxious to impose upon them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theopompus, or
        Athenæus, to use the name which was commonly given him from his
        birthplace, was a follower of the philosophy of Epicurus. He had held
        a subordinate post, as lecturer in geometry, in the famous school of
        the Garden, but had found his modest income insufficient to meet his
        somewhat expensive tastes. If he had had but a tolerable competence,
        Athenæus would have made an ideal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Epicurean. He was devoted to pleasure, but there
        was nothing unseemly or extravagant about his devotion. For the
        foolish people who ruined their constitutions and emptied their
        purses by exhausting excesses he had a genuine contempt. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give me,”</span> he would say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a decent sufficiency of <span class="tei tei-q">‘outside
        things,’</span> and I am content.”</span> As he had a fair smattering
        of culture, and a real acquaintance with geometry, and had a
        venerable appearance which happily hit the mean between hilarity and
        austerity, he might have been, but for a chronic want of money, a
        real success among the somewhat <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">dilettante</span></span> philosophers of Athens.
        But circumstances were against him. Poverty did not ill become an
        Academic, and positively set off a Stoic; but an Epicurean seemed to
        have missed his vocation if he could not be always handsomely dressed
        and able to give elegant entertainments to his friends. Athenæus, who
        liked above all things to be on good terms both with himself and with
        every one else, felt this very acutely, and he was proportionately
        delighted when the Syrian King proposed to him that he should go as a
        teacher, not without a handsome salary, of Greek religion and Greek
        culture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His success was
        not encouraging. In the first place he had a difficulty in making
        himself understood. The pure Attic Greek on which he prided himself
        was strange to the ears of his new audience, and he could not bring
        himself to descend to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg
        98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>barbarous dialect to which they were accustomed.
        And when he was seriously called to account in the matter of his
        belief he found himself involved in difficulties from which he saw no
        way of escape. At Athens religion was politely ignored. The common
        people must, of course, have their gods and goddesses; and the wise
        man, if he were prudent, would say nothing—anyhow in public—to
        disturb their belief; but within the privileged walls of the schools
        the names of Zeus and Athené and Apollo were never so much as
        mentioned, except, perhaps, in the course of some antiquarian
        discussion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among his new
        disciples, as he would fain have reckoned them, Athenæus found a very
        different temper. They were terribly in earnest; abstractions and
        phrases did not satisfy them; they pushed their questions home in a
        very perplexing way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day at the
        conclusion of a lecture, the customary invitation to the audience to
        put any questions that might occur to them was accepted by a young
        man who sat on one of the front benches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I would ask you, venerable sir,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“some questions about the gods of your
        religion.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Speak on,”</span> replied Athenæus, with his usual
        courtesy; <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be delighted to satisfy
        you to the best of my power.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Are we to believe the stories that are told us in this
        book?”</span> and he held up, as he spoke, a little volume of popular
        mythology, filled from beginning to end <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>with tales that, to say the least, were not
        edifying. <span class="tei tei-q">“For, if these be true, these
        divine beings were such as would be banished from the society of all
        honest men and women. They are thieves, adulterers, murderers. It
        would be a thousand times better to have no gods at all than such as
        these.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are right, sir,”</span> said the lecturer;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“these stories are for the ignorant only, at
        least in their outward meaning, though they have an inner meaning
        also, which I will take some fitting occasion to expound. But not
        such are the gods whom we worship.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Will you tell us something of them?”</span> continued
        the questioner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Willingly, for they are such that the wisest of men need

        happy. Wrath they feel not, nor sorrow, nor any of the passions that
        disturb the souls of men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And do they care for our doings upon earth?”</span></p>

        affairs.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What profit, then, is there in them? How are men the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That I know not; only that it is part of the order of
        things that they must be.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Far be it from me,”</span> exclaimed the young Jew,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to exchange for such idle existences the God

        "Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fathers! He may smite
        us in His anger till we are well-nigh consumed, but at least He cares
        for us. He led our fathers through the sea and through the wilderness
        in the days of old. He has spoken to us by the prophets, and He has
        made His Presence to be seen in His Temple; and though He has hidden
        His face from us for a time, yet He will repent Him of His wrath, and
        devise the means by which He shall recall His banished unto Him. No,
        we will not change our God for yours!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A loud murmur of
        assent went round the benches when the speaker sat down, and Athenæus
        felt that he had made but small way with his audience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finding his
        theology and philosophy but ill received, Athenæus bethought him of
        what seemed a more hopeful method of proselytizing. Could not a
        specially powerful attraction be found in the festival of Dionysus,
        the wine-god? Vintage feasts, he reflected, are common to every
        country where wine is produced, and it would not be difficult to
        ingraft the Greek characteristics on a celebration to which the Jews
        were already accustomed. Some of the less scrupulous might be tempted
        to take part in such a festival, a beginning would be made, and more
        would follow in due time. How the scheme prospered will be told in

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Things are growing worse and worse; only three customers
        yesterday, and not a single one to-day, though it must be at least an
        hour past noon. One would think that all the world had become
        Nazarites. Then, though there is next to nothing coming in, there is
        no stop to the going out. First comes the rascally tax-gatherer, and
        squeezes one as dry as a grape-skin in a press. And if, by chance,
        there happens to be a drop left, some snuffling priest is sure to
        turn up, and talk about one’s duty as a patriot and a Jew till he
        drags the last shekel out of one.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The speaker was
        one Shallum, a Benjamite, who kept a little wine-shop in the Lower
        City. When he had finished his grumble, he thrust his hand into an
        empty wine-jar, drew from it a little leathern bag, untied the string
        which was round the neck, poured out the scanty contents on the
        counter and counted them. He knew the amount perfectly well, for he
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102"
        id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had gone through the counting
        process at least ten times before that day. But when a man is
        desperately anxious to make two ends meet, he will measure them again
        and again, though he may know exactly by how much they are too
        short.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Twelve shekels and ten annas! And old Nahum will be here
        to-morrow, asking for his thirty shekels!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nahum was a
        Lebanon wine-grower, whose long-suffering had been already tried to
        the utmost by the delays of the impecunious Shallum.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment his
        meditations were interrupted by the entrance of two visitors, who had
        been standing, listening and watching outside the door. They were
        traders in a small way, who had migrated from Joppa when they heard
        that Greek wares were becoming the fashion in Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ho! Shallum,”</span> cried one of them, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“two cups of your best Lebanon; and make haste, for we
        have important business on hand.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shall I draw some water fresh from the well? This is a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Water!”</span> said the man. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Jew, don’t blaspheme. Mix water with our wine to-day, of
        all days in the year!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And why not to-day?”</span> said Shallum.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Because it is the feast of Dionysus, the wine-giver; and

        weakness; but to-day it is different. May he confound me if I do him
        such dishonour!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He will certainly confound you if you drink this heady
        wine undiluted,”</span> muttered Shallum to himself, as he set the
        two cups before his guests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Excellent! excellent!”</span> cried Lycon, the elder of
        the two Greeks, as he set down his goblet, half empty. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But why the god vouchsafes such capital drink to these
        unbelieving dogs of Jews puzzles me beyond expression.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His companion
        broke out into a drinking-song:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum was fairly
        tolerant, as indeed a tavern-keeper can hardly fail to be, of the
        ways and manners of his customers; but to hear this praise of a false
        god, one of the odious demons that were worshipped by the heathen,
        was too much for his patience. He muttered a curse under his breath,
        and emphasized this expression of disgust by spitting on the
        floor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Don’t talk to me of your gods and goddesses!”</span>
        cried Shallum, goaded beyond all endurance, <span class=

        would have anything to do with!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, my friend,”</span> said the Greek, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“this is not the sort of talk which one expects to hear
        from a loyal subject of the pious Antiochus. We Greeks are not such
        bigots as you are, cursing every man, woman, or child that does not
        go exactly in our own way; but you must treat us and our belongings
        with respect. We are not going to have barbarians scoffing at what we
        think fit to worship. I have heard of men being crucified for less
        than you have said to-day. But hearken, Shallum, we did not come here
        to-day to quarrel with you. You are a good fellow, after all, and
        keep as capital a tap of wine as any that I know, King Tmolus<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        excepted. We want you to come with us and have a jolly day. What is
        the good of quarrelling about words? You and we are quite agreed that
        there is something in wine that makes it one of the finest things
        under the sun. Suppose that we choose to call that something Dionysus
        the Wine-god, and you choose to say that your god has to do with it,
        what is the difference? We are really agreed. It is the goodness in
        wine that we both like, and I’m sure that a really honest fellow like
        you, that we can always rely on to give us the right stuff, should be
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105"
        id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the first to acknowledge it.
        Well, can’t we show an agreement? That is why we want you to come
        with us. A whole crowd of your countrymen are coming, I understand.
        It will be a pretty sight, and there will be some of the finest music
        that you ever heard, and dancing, and fun of all kinds, and, of
        course, as much wine as ever you want. Of course you will come, my
        dear Shallum?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I</span></span> come?”</span> growled the
        wine-seller. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not I! What do I care about
        your dancing and singing? And as for wine, I can have as much as I
        want at home, and better stuff, too, than any that I am likely to get
        elsewhere.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lycon, who was
        evidently bent on getting his way, did not suffer his good humour to
        be disturbed by the Jew’s churlishness. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
        reminds me. Stupid fellow that I am, I quite forgot the matter of
        business that really brought me here. To tell the truth, business and
        this old Lebanon don’t very well agree. But listen; Neocles, who is
        manager-in-chief of the whole festival, has quite made up his mind to
        have your wine, and none but yours, for all the better sort of
        people. He was to get some skins for the common folks from Zadok—do
        you know him?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Know him?”</span> said Shallum; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I should think I did—hasn’t got a drop of sound wine in
        his shop.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So the Chief said. But we were to come to you for the
        good wine. What can you let us have? <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Mind that it must be the very best. We were not
        to haggle about the price, Neocles said, so long as we got it really
        good.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Lycon pulled
        out of his pocket a money-bag that was evidently much better
        furnished than Shallum’s lean and hunger-bitten purse. Untying the
        neck, he poured into his hand, with an air of careless profusion,
        some ten or twelve gold pieces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum’s keen
        eyes glistened at the sight. Here was enough to pay not only Nahum
        but all his creditors, and leave him a handsome sum over wherewith to
        tide over the hard times. His somewhat brusque manner changed in a
        moment. He was now the most obsequious of tradesmen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Everything in my stores is at your disposal. And I have
        a better wine than this in my cellar, and only ten shekels a
        skin,”</span> he went on, adding about three to the utmost he
        expected to get. <span class="tei tei-q">“But wait a moment,
        gentlemen, you shall taste it for yourselves.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He took a small
        flagon from beneath the counter and disappeared. The two Greeks
        smiled to each other. <span class="tei tei-q">“We have the fish
        fast,”</span> one of them said; <span class="tei tei-q">“after all
        there is nothing like a golden bait.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum shortly
        reappeared with the wine, which was tasted and approved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said Lycon, <span class="tei tei-q">“we
        will say ten skins of this at ten shekels a piece, and five of the
        other sort at eight—that is the price; is it
        not?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg
        107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum nodded
        assent. As a matter of fact he would never have expected more than
        seven. But if these Greeks were so free with their money why should
        not an honest Jew have the benefit of it?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course you will come with us?”</span> said Lycon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You may take my word for it, there will be nothing to
        offend you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum hesitated
        for a moment, and then muttered an unwilling <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And you won’t mind wearing this little twig of ivy, just
        twisted round your head? It means nothing—every one does
        it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was more than
        the wretched man was prepared for. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not
        I,”</span> he said; <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not going to wear
        any of your idolatrous ornaments.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lycon put the
        money-bag into his pocket again. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then, my
        dear Shallum, I am afraid we shall not be able to do any business.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Give and take’</span> is our motto. We put a
        nice little bargain in your way; and you must humour us. However, if
        you are obstinate, there must be an end of it. I dare say Zadok can
        find us what we want. Come, Callicles,”</span> he went on, turning to
        his companion, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-corr">we</span> must be going.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum saw his
        dreams of deliverance from his money-troubles vanishing into air, and
        grew desperate. <span class="tei tei-q">“Stop,”</span> he said to his
        guests, <span class="tei tei-q">“let me think for a moment. You won’t
        ask me to do anything else. A few leaves can’t make much odds
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108"
        id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>either way. I don’t remember
        ever hearing anything in the Law against wearing ivy. It isn’t like
        eating swine’s flesh, or those detestable scaleless eels that you
        Greeks are so fond of. Yes, I’ll wear the thing, if you want me to so
        much.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That’s right, Shallum; I thought a sensible man like you
        would not throw away a good chance for a mere nothing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying, Lycon
        stepped outside the shop, and whistled. In a minute or so a cart,
        which had been waiting round the corner, was driven up. The skins of
        wine were stowed away in it, and the two Greeks, with Shallum between
        them, all wearing the ivy-wreath, took their seats, and started for
        the Valley of the Cheesemongers, where it had been arranged that the
        festival should be held.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The festival was
        scarcely a success, if it was meant, as it certainly was, to attract
        the Jewish population. A few hundreds, indeed, had been persuaded or
        compelled to be present. Most of them belonged to the lowest and most
        degraded class, wretched creatures whom any purchaser might secure
        for any purpose with a shekel or a flagon of wine. To-day they were
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hail fellow well met”</span> with their
        Greek neighbours, but to-morrow they would be perfectly ready to tear
        them in pieces. A few of somewhat better character had been bribed,
        as Shallum had been bribed, to come. These had little of the air of
        genuine holiday-makers. Their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>bursts of simulated gaiety did not conceal the
        shame which they really felt. Others, again, did not make even this
        pretence of hilarity. They had been actually compelled to come, and
        they had all the air of prisoners led in the triumphant procession of
        a victorious general. Their faces were ghastly pale. Some, with their
        teeth firmly clenched, seemed to be forcibly keeping in the curses
        which struggled to find utterance. Others, of a gentler temper, were
        weeping silently; and others, again, preserved a look of dogged
        indifference. The Greek part of the spectators, who could have
        enjoyed the humours of the scene with a good conscience, were
        depressed by the presence of these unwilling guests. In consequence,
        everything seemed to fail. The jesters, with their grotesque garb and
        faces hideously smeared with wine-lees, could scarcely get a laugh
        from their audience; the singing lacked heartiness, the dancing was
        dull and spiritless. It is only natural that revellers, who find the
        time passing slowly, should try to quicken its movement. There was
        little brightness or gaiety in this feast of the wine-god, and there
        was therefore all the more excess. Some seized the rare opportunity
        of intoxicating themselves without expense, while others drank to
        drown their shame or their anger. Shallum, whose occupation had
        somewhat seasoned him against the effects of wine, remained
        comparatively sober, but his Greek companions were less discreet
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110"
        id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or less strong-headed. They
        became, by a rapid succession of moods, boisterously gay, foolishly
        affectionate, and provokingly quarrelsome. It was not long before
        things came to a crisis. Lycon taunted the wine-seller with the
        quality of his wines; that did not affect him, for he was used to
        such complaints from his customers, and took them as part of his
        day’s work. He scoffed at the subjection of his nation to Greek rule;
        Shallum still kept his temper. The tipsy Greek was only encouraged to
        further insults by his companion’s self-restraint. He attempted to
        daub the Jew’s face with the dregs from a broken flagon. Shallum
        angrily shook him off, and he reeled back, just saving himself from a
        fall by catching at the trunk of an olive tree. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hog of a Jew!”</span> he cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“do you lay hands on a free-born Greek? Come,
        Callicles,”</span> he went on, turning to his companion, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“let us teach the beast how to behave himself.”</span>
        The two rushed at the Jew, aiming blows at his head with the staves
        which they carried in their hands. One of them stumbled against the
        stones of a ruined house, and fell so heavily that he was unable or
        unwilling to raise himself again. Shallum easily evaded the attack of
        the other, dealing him at the same time so fierce a stroke of the
        fist that it stretched him senseless on the ground. The deed done, he
        looked hastily round to see whether any spectator had witnessed it.
        To his great relief, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg
        111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class=

        the sounds of furious revelry and the strains of the Bacchic
        chorus—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His first impulse
        was to tear the ivy-wreath from his head. Then he reflected that if
        he could endure to wear it for a few moments longer, it might serve
        him as a passport. The event proved that he was right. He passed
        unquestioned through the crowd of revellers, left the precincts of
        the valley, and striking on an unfrequented path, hurried on at the
        top of his speed, not pausing till he had put at least six miles
        between himself and the scene of his late adventure. Then he threw
        himself on the ground and bewailed his grievous fall in an agony of
        shame and remorse. After a while the fatigue and excitement of the
        day, helped by the fumes of the wine, which his rapid movements had
        sent to his brain, overpowered him, and he sank into a heavy
        sleep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His slumbers
        lasted late into the day. When he woke, his head aching with the
        excess of the day before, he felt even more wretched, more hopeless.
        To return to the city was out of the question. But where was he to
        go? While he was debating this question with himself, and could find
        nothing in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
        112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class=

        of approaching footsteps. Mingled feelings of shame and fear
        suggested to him that he should hide himself, and he plunged into the
        bushes which lined the side of the road.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The traveller
        approached. He was a renegade Jew, and Shallum recognized him as one
        who had taken an active part in the festivities of the preceding day.
        Just as he passed Shallum’s hiding-place an unlucky impulse made him
        burst forth into a snatch of the Bacchic chant—</p>

        the words with mingled feelings of disgust and rage, and leaping down
        into the road felled him senseless to the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first it seemed
        as if what he had done did not make his way plainer before him. But
        as he stood by the prostrate man a thought occurred to him. He took
        the purse which the man, in the usual traveller’s fashion, wore by
        way of girdle round his waist, and examined its contents. It held
        three gold pieces and some ten shekels. The gold he left; but half of
        the shekels he transferred to his own keeping. One of the shekels
        sufficed to purchase some bread and dried flesh at the neighbouring
        village. Thus recruited in strength the fugitive made his escape to
        the mountains.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Menander, or
        Micah—the young man still wavered between the two moods which were
        symbolized by these names—had been greatly moved, as we have said, by
        what he had seen and heard in his visit to his sister and her
        husband. But he could not shake himself free from the habits and
        prepossessions of years. Though he had always kept aloof from the
        worst excesses of his renegade and heathen friends, still his moral
        tone had been lowered, and even his physical nerve weakened by a
        frivolous and self-indulgent life. Sometimes he would half resolve to
        cast in his lot with his people. Sometimes, again, the cynical or
        doubting temper returned. What madness it would be, so the evil voice
        whispered to him, to sacrifice all that made life pleasant, and, very
        possibly, life itself, for what both philosophers and practical men
        of the world agreed in pronouncing to be a delusion!</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Till this question
        had been settled one way or the other, he found it impossible to
        rest. The city became odious to him, for he shrank from the sight of
        his fellow-men. Indeed, he did not know with whom to associate. His
        Greek or Greek-loving acquaintances, with their frivolities and
        vices, disgusted him; and the patriots regarded him with coldness and
        aversion. Solitude, he fancied, might suit him better, and he went
        again to his country house at Lebanon. But he found himself worse off
        than ever where there was nothing to come between his thoughts and
        himself, and he hastened back to Jerusalem. Then it suddenly occurred
        to him that his sister had been expecting shortly to become a mother,
        and he made his way to her house to inquire of her welfare. Azariah
        himself answered his knock.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How is Hannah?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thanks be to the Lord,”</span> replied Azariah,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“she is well. She had an easy
        travail.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Lord has given us a son.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But he said it
        without the gladness that a Jewish father, newly blessed with the
        hope that there should be one to preserve his name in Israel, should
        have felt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But you must come in and see him, for indeed he is of a
        singular beauty.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man
        followed his host into the chamber already described, and sat down to
        wait. Presently <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
        115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Azariah reappeared, holding the child in his
        arms. It was no father’s fondness that had made him speak of his
        singular beauty. The child was but five days old; but he had none of
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“shapeless”</span> look which is commonly
        to be seen in the newly born. His features were shaped with a
        regularity most uncommon at so tender an age, and his complexion
        beautifully clear, while his little head was surrounded with what may
        be called a halo of golden hair.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah was loud in
        his admiration. <span class="tei tei-q">“I never saw his equal for
        beauty. You are indeed a happy father to have the fairest son in all
        Israel.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The smile on
        Azariah’s face faded away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I would not be thankless for the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘gift that cometh from the Lord,’</span> nor wanting in
        faith; yet I sometimes cannot but think that in these days the
        childless are the happiest, or, I should rather say, the least
        unhappy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course you will be prudent,”</span> said Micah,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and yield to the necessities of the time.
        Put off the circumcision of the child. There can be no harm in that.
        And when Hannah has got her strength again, you can come down to my
        place in the Lebanon, and it can be done quietly, without any one
        being the wiser.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah said
        nothing. He turned away his face, but not before his brother-in-law
        had seen his eyes fill with tears. After leaving some loving messages
        for his sister the young man departed, hoping, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>though not without some serious doubt,
        that his advice would be followed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week after, when
        the question, he knew, would have been decided one way or the other,
        he bent his steps again towards his sister’s house. As he walked
        through the streets he could see that the persecutors were busy at
        their work. Fires were burning here and there, and copies of the Law
        and the other holy books were being burned in them. From a house
        which he recognized as being the dwelling of a scribe of great
        learning, a party of Greek soldiers burst forth, as he passed,
        dragging behind them a richly-ornamented scroll of the Psalms. For a
        moment the wild impulse surged in his heart to rescue the sacred
        writing from the flames; but he recognized the hopelessness of the
        attempt; and, indeed, he sadly asked himself, was he fit to be a
        champion of holy things? A soldier gathered up the parchment in his
        arms, and tossed it in a heap on the fire. Part of it opened as it
        fell, and Micah saw for a few moments before the flames reached them,
        words which he never forgot till his dying day: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Princes have persecuted me without a cause, yet do I not
        swerve from Thy commandments.”</span> As he stood and looked, with a
        rage in his heart which he could not express, two more soldiers came
        out of the house, holding between them the scribe himself, a
        venerable man, in whom Micah recognized an old friend of his
        father’s. They threw him down, face foremost, on <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the fire, and held him there till he was
        <span class="tei tei-corr">suffocated.</span> But before the tragedy
        was finished, the young Jew had turned away, feeling in his heart
        that the question which he had been debating so long was being
        rapidly settled for him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blow that was
        to clinch his conclusions was not long in falling. As he came near
        the bottom of the little hill on the top of which stood his sister’s
        house, he saw a cross, and, bound to it by cords, what seemed to be
        the figure of a woman, with a dead child hung round her neck. The sun
        had set, and the light was failing with the rapidity that is
        characteristic of a southern latitude.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Truly these Greeks have a strange way of showing their
        love of beauty. We have had sickening sights in Jerusalem of late
        enough to make their name stink in our nostrils for ever. What poor
        wretch is this? How has she offended our masters? And the child—what
        treason can he have been guilty of?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And as he spoke a
        dreadful fear shot through his heart. After all—for he knew what a
        dauntless spirit his sister had shown at their last meeting—after all
        they might have circumcised the child and brought down upon
        themselves the vengeance of the persecutors. He turned aside from the
        road and ran up to the terrible object. It was almost dark by the
        time he reached it, and he had to light a torch which he carried with
        him in case of need, before he could <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>see what the object really was. Then one glance
        was enough. The features of the woman were black and swollen; but he
        recognized them in a moment. It was the face of Hannah, his sister.
        But a month before he had seen it beaming with light and love, and
        now—— Had he needed any confirmation he would have found it in the
        child. The features were beyond recognition; but the golden halo of
        hair was there; its brightness scarcely dimmed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He sank upon his
        knees, and lifting his hands to heaven he cursed the authors of this
        wickedness, and swore that he would give all his life to avenge the
        innocent blood. Then rising he hastened to the house of Azariah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He found a
        considerable company assembled. They were deep in debate about the
        course of action to be pursued when Micah, who had been met by
        Azariah at the door, was introduced into the room. Most of those
        present were acquainted with him, at least by reputation, and they
        were naturally disposed to consider his presence an intrusion. But it
        was soon manifest that the new comer was not indifferent, much less
        hostile, to their objects.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hear me, brethren,”</span> he cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“if, indeed, one so unworthy as I may call you
        brethren,”</span> and he went on to recount the struggles with which
        his mind had been agitated during the weeks just past. Then, after
        briefly touching on what he had just seen, he went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have sinned; I have forsaken the Law <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of my God; I have defiled myself by a
        companionship with the heathen; and though I have not worshipped
        their false gods”</span>—there was a sigh of relief from the company
        as he uttered these words with a solemn emphasis—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“yet I have been a guest at the feasts of their temples.
        If, therefore, you judge me to have transgressed beyond all pardon,
        cast me out from your company; I can find some other way to do
        service for the country that I have betrayed, and the God whom I have
        denied. Yet, if you think me worthy of death, I do not refuse to
        die.”</span> And he drew a dagger from his belt, and offering it to
        one who seemed to be a leader in the assembly, stood with bared
        breast before him.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A murmur of
        admiration ran through the meeting.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, brother,”</span> said the man whom he addressed,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“this is not the time to take one soldier
        from the hosts of the Lord. You have sinned in the past; make amends
        in the future. There will be time and opportunity enough. And if you
        are the brother of her who has witnessed a good confession even unto
        death, you will not fail to use the occasion that shall
        come.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The company then
        resumed the debate which had been interrupted by Micah’s arrival.
        Little difference of opinion indeed remained among them, and when the
        president, Seraiah by name, brother-in-law of Azariah, as being the
        husband of his sister Ruth, stated his views they met with general
        assent.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg
        120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We have seen enough,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and suffered enough. This city is polluted, and is no
        longer a fit abode for the faithful. Let them that are in Judæa flee
        unto the mountains. Meanwhile we will gather together such as have
        not bowed the knee to Baal, and will make head against the oppressor.
        But here we shall be struck down, and perish as a beast perishes in
        the pit into which he has fallen.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this the
        company dispersed to make such preparation as they could for their
        departure, which was fixed for the night following. Micah and Seraiah
        remained behind in the house of mourning. Azariah withdrew to comfort
        his little girls, who were crying almost incessantly for their
        mother. Comfort he needed sorely for himself, and he found it, as far
        as it could be found, in this fatherly care. Every look and gesture
        of the little ones reminded him of her whom he had lost, and seemed
        to open the wound afresh. Yet it consoled him to talk to them about
        their mother, to tell the story of her early days, to remind them,
        though they did not need to be reminded, of all her goodness and
        love, and to picture her happiness where she sat in Paradise with the
        holy women of old, with Miriam, and Sarah, and Rachel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile Seraiah
        told the story of Hannah’s end to Micah. <span class="tei tei-q">“We
        came together,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the
        eighth day after the birth of her child; but though all was prepared
        for the circumcision of the boy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>we had not yet resolved what was to be done. I
        know that I wavered—I confess it with shame—and so did Azariah. And,
        indeed, I can scarcely find it in my heart to blame him. He had no
        thought of his own life, but to risk his wife’s and the child’s—that
        was terrible. And there were others who advised him to yield for the
        time; the risk was too terrible. Indeed, that was the feeling of most
        of us, and those who thought otherwise were unwilling to speak. We
        were assembled, you know, in your sister’s chamber. She sat on the
        bed, holding the little one in her arms. Her face was somewhat pale;
        but she had a calm and steadfast look, like the look of one who
        watches his adversary in the battle line of the enemy, and there was
        a fire in her eyes, such as I have never seen in the eye of woman
        before. When I had spoken, counselling delay and yielding for a while
        to the necessities of the time, I turned to her and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘And you, Hannah, what think
        you?’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then she spoke, and her voice never faltered for a
        moment, but was clear and full, though indeed she never raised it
        above the pitch that becomes the obedience and modesty of the woman.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Pardon me,’</span> she said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘fathers and brethren, if I seem, in differing from your
        counsel, to reproach you. I am but a weak woman, and know nothing of
        policy or of the needs of the time. But I know the thing that the
        Lord our God has commanded: <span class="tei tei-q">“Every man-child
        among you shall be circumcised,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“whosoever shall not be
        circumcised that soul shall be cut off from among his people.”</span>
        The Lord hath given me this child, and shall I not do for him
        according to the commandment? Shall we fear man rather than God? And
        for myself, is it a new thing for a mother to give her life into the
        hand of God? Four times already have I so given it, and He has
        restored it to me. And if it be His will that it be taken, shall I
        not obey? What said the Holy Children when Nebuchadnezzar would have
        had them fall down and worship the golden image, lest they should be
        cast into the burning fiery furnace. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our God
        whom we serve is able to deliver us out of thy hand, and He will
        deliver us out of thy hand, O King; but if
        not——”</span> ’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then she turned to her husband, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘What shall be his name?’</span> as steadily and quietly
        as if there had been no question of danger or fear. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Let his name be David,’</span> said the father, as he
        took the babe from its mother’s arms; for the sun was about to set,
        and in a few moments the due time would be past. So they carried the
        child into the next room. And when your sister heard his cry, she
        broke forth into blessings and thanksgiving. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Thanks be to Thee, O Lord,’</span> she cried,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘in that Thou hast made him a child of the
        Covenant. And now I beseech Thee to grant that he may walk before
        Thee all the days of his life as walked Thy servant David, and that
        he may sit down with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg

        heaven.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“After that she bade us stay and partake of the feast
        which she had caused to be prepared. Verily she had left nothing
        uncared for. Never was her table better spread, and, as you know, she
        was a notable housekeeper. And though, for her weakness, she could
        not sit at table with us, she was gay and cheerful even beyond her
        wont, so that we men, for very shame, had to banish the care from our
        faces, and laugh and be merry with her. But the next day the soldiers
        came and beat Azariah, as they thought, to death, and——”</span> The
        speaker paused; indeed he could not speak for the choking tears. At
        last he said, in a broken voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“What need
        to tell the rest? You know it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next night
        Azariah, Seraiah, Micah, and a company of some thirty men and women
        left Jerusalem. Part of them were on foot, but an ass had been found
        to carry Ruth, Seraiah’s wife, who was expecting shortly to become a
        mother. Their destination was the hill-country that went by the name
        of the Wilderness of Bethaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time is
        evening; the place is a rocky pass between Bethel and Michmash. At
        the mouth of a cave which commands a view of the approach from the
        westward, are seated two men, in one of whom we may recognize
        Shallum, the quondam wine-seller of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, comrade,”</span> he is saying to his companion,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“this business is not quite to my liking. It
        is all very well when we can relieve a Greek merchant, or, better
        still, a Syrian tax-gatherer, of his money-bags; but I hate robbing
        our own people. That poor fellow to-day, for instance, who was taking
        home his wages—he had been wood-cutting, he said, in Bashan—it really
        went to my heart to take the money from him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The companion whom
        he addressed was a rough, savage-looking fellow, who certainly did
        not look as if he would feel very much for Shallum’s scruples.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125"
        id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He had followed, indeed, the
        robber’s trade, it may be said, from his childhood, as his fathers
        had followed it before him, almost since the days of the
        Captivity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He now broke out
        into a loud, mocking laugh.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! my friend Shallum,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you are a great deal too soft and tender-hearted. But
        then you are new to the business; when you have been at it as long as
        I have, you won’t have these scruples. Now, mark what I say; and if
        we are to be good friends, don’t let me hear any more of this
        nonsense. You are a stout fellow and a man of your hands; and as for
        myself, well, I rather think that a novice like you could hardly have
        come across a better teacher. I don’t doubt that we shall do very
        well together; and when we have made a little money, I shan’t blame
        you if you give up the business and become what they call an honest
        man. For myself, the <span class="tei tei-q">‘honest man’</span> line
        does not suit me—it is not in my blood, you know. But, meanwhile, if
        we are to work together, we must agree. Now, all is fish that comes
        to our net. Of course, I don’t mean the people about here—our
        neighbours, you know. We must not touch them; on the contrary, they
        must have a share of what we make. As long as they are our friends we
        are safe. But all strangers are lawful booty. And mind—for I see that
        you are a little wroth about this—mind, it is only dead men who tell
        no tales.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benjamin’s words
        of wisdom—the more experienced of the two robbers was named
        Benjamin—were interrupted by an exclamation from his companion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hush!”</span> he cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“I hear
        a sound of voices from the pass.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two men
        listened; Shallum was evidently right. A party of travellers were
        approaching from the west.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We are in luck,”</span> said Benjamin; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it is not often that we do business so late in the
        day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke the
        leaders of the party emerged into sight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shoot, Shallum!”</span> said Benjamin; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“strike one of those fellows down and we shall have the
        whole party in confusion.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, Benjamin; I hear the voices of women and children;
        and see—God wither my hand if I shoot at such helpless people as
        these.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rest of the
        party was now in sight. Two men, one on either side of the ass, were
        supporting Ruth, who, worn out by the fatigues of the day, could with
        difficulty keep her seat on the animal. These were her husband and
        Azariah. Close behind came Micah, carrying on his shoulder the little
        Judith, who was fast asleep. Then followed Miriam, Judith’s elder
        sister. The poor child limped sadly along, for her city life had been
        but a poor training for that long day’s march, and she felt just
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127"
        id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a little envious of the good
        fortune which Judith enjoyed in being carried.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum recognized
        the figures of Seraiah and Ruth, with whom he happened to have had
        some slight acquaintance in Jerusalem, and from whom indeed he had
        received no little kindness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Benjamin,”</span> he said, in a determined voice,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I know these people, and if I can help it
        they shall suffer no harm.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, well; have your way,”</span> said his companion,
        who indeed was not quite as hard of heart as he would make himself
        out. <span class="tei tei-q">“If, as you say, you know them, go down
        and make friends.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shallum at once
        made his way down into the pass, and, standing in the path, greeted
        the travellers with the customary salutation, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peace be with you!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What, Shallum!”</span> said Seraiah, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is that you? What brings you here?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That were a long story,”</span> returned the man,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and this is not the time to tell it. But can
        I serve you?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Can you find shelter for my poor wife? But it is idle, I
        fear, to ask you. There can be no inn near this wild
        place.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis true, sir, there is no inn; yet if you can put up
        with such poor lodging as we can give, the lady will have at least
        shelter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth was lifted
        from her seat on the ass, and carried between her husband and Azariah
        up the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name=
        "Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rocky track that led to
        the cave, Shallum showing the way with a lighted torch in his hand,
        for by this time the night had fallen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benjamin met the
        little party at the mouth of the cave. His life of crime had not
        quenched all kindly feeling in him. He felt, too, that he was a host;
        and the sense of hospitality, which keeps its hold on an Eastern
        heart as long as anything good is left to it, bade him do his best
        for his guests. And the sweet smile of thanks with which Ruth greeted
        him when she was laid on the couch of cloaks, which the two inmates
        of the cave had hastily arranged on a pile of heather, won him
        altogether.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A minute or two
        afterwards Micah followed with the two children; Judith, still fast
        asleep, was put down by Ruth’s side, while Miriam forgot her fatigue
        in the delightful excitement of this new adventure. The new-comers
        had brought with them a slender store of provisions. These they
        proceeded to share, declining with thanks the dried flesh and wine
        which their entertainers offered. The rest of the party found
        shelter, under guidance of the robbers, in some of the many caves
        with which the rocks in the neighbourhood were honeycombed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next morning the
        arrangements for housing the little colony were made. There was an
        abundance of caves to give shelter to all, and the accommodation
        though rough, at least protected them from the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>weather. Their life was simple in the
        extreme—simple even to hardness. They sought for herbs and roots, and
        from the neighbouring peasants they bought a few goats, to browse
        among the rocks, and a small quantity of corn, which they bruised
        between stones and baked. The mountain springs furnished their drink,
        a few flasks of wine being reserved for any cases of sickness. Twice
        a day the whole company met for worship. Seraiah read a portion first
        from the Law and then from the Prophets, for they had not forgotten
        to bring rolls of the Sacred Books. Then standing erect, with covered
        heads, their faces turned towards the Temple, they joined in prayer.
        In the words of one who himself in old time had found himself shut
        out for a while from the privileges of the Holy Place and was content
        to realize them by faith, the congregation uttered together the
        petition, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let my prayer be set forth in Thy
        sight as the incense; and let the lifting up of my hands be an
        evening sacrifice.”</span> One of the psalms of penitence followed;
        for surely they had all many sins to repent of—sins of which they
        were now suffering the penalty; and, after the psalm, a prayer for
        deliverance from the enemy, and for the setting up again of the
        throne of David, and for that without which neither deliverance nor a
        restored kingdom could profit them—purity and righteousness in their
        own hearts and souls.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing could be
        more simple and frugal than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg
        130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>their daily fare. Wild fruits and herbs were
        largely used, and any little plots of fertile ground that could be
        found were planted with vegetables, some far-seeing member of the
        party having brought with him a small supply of garden seeds. When a
        few days after their arrival Ruth gave birth to a son it was much
        feared that the scanty supply of nourishing food might long delay her
        restoration to strength. This fear was not realized. The feeling of
        freedom and deliverance combined with the fine mountain air to bring
        her back to her wonted health, and she found herself able to go about
        her daily work long before she could have hoped to do so in the more
        enervating atmosphere of the city.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day she had
        gone to gather herbs for the daily mess, a work in which she was
        especially useful from the knowledge of plants which she had taken
        pains to acquire in her unmarried days. She had taken, of course, the
        new-born infant with her, and Miriam, who was delighted to perform,
        as far as her strength permitted, the office of nurse. The little
        Judith, whose night’s rest had been disturbed by some childish
        ailment, had been left at home to make up her allowance of sleep. The
        mother found on her return that a strange visitor had made herself at
        home in the cave. The little one was fast asleep on a bed of rugs
        which had been made up for her, and curled up at her side with one of
        her fore paws <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
        131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>round her neck was a jackal. The two companions
        were roused together by the arrival of the party, and, wonderful to
        relate, neither showed any symptoms of alarm. The jackal rose from
        its resting-place, approached Ruth, and fawned at her feet, and the
        child came after its bedfellow and stroked affectionately its shaggy
        skin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, two or three
        weeks afterwards, the new comer gave birth to a litter of cubs, the
        joy of the children was complete. The little animals soon learnt to
        play with the girls, and their dam sat by and watched their gambols,
        and sometimes even condescended to join in them herself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little colony
        heard of the strange incident with delight, and saw in it a token of
        Divine favour. <span class="tei tei-q">“Man rages cruelly against
        us,”</span> they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“but we find friends

        the heart of this savage dweller in the wilderness, and we will trust
        that He will do yet greater things than these.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question

        unclean.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seraiah thought

        Canaan.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So thenceforward

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A wayfarer, who
        described himself as a discharged soldier and a Moabite by birth,
        asked for shelter and food. Scanty as were the means of the
        fugitives, they did not grudge the stranger a share of their meal.
        They gave him their best, adding to their daily fare the special
        luxury of some dried grapes. As he complained of being footsore, Ruth
        applied some simple remedies to the blisters on his feet. Altogether
        he was treated not only as a welcome but even as an honoured guest.
        On his part he professed a fervent sympathy with the hopes and plans
        of his hosts. The next morning he started as if to continue his
        journey. But the cupidity of the wretch had been roused by the sight
        of the handsome earrings—almost the sole remaining relic of former
        affluence—which he had spied in his hostess’s ears. About an hour
        before noon, when he judged that the men would be still busy about
        their daily work, he crept back to the cave. Ruth was sitting
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133"
        id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by a fire nursing her babe. The
        jackal lay asleep in a corner; the girls were playing with the cubs
        on a sunny little plot of ground outside.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        poor fellow who has not so much as a copper coin to buy him a piece
        of bread?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth was startled
        at his re-appearance, but concealed her alarm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        though you had done better, I should think, to keep on your way, for
        you can hardly find any that are poorer than we.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, lady,”</span> he went on, with a perceptible tone
        of threatening in his voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“those earrings
        that you wear are doubtless of true metal. They add, indeed, to your
        beauty, and it is a pity that you should lose them; but then there is
        no one to admire you in this wilderness, and they would keep a poor
        fellow like myself in flesh and wine for a month or more.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, your earrings, lady,”</span> said the man.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I should advise you to take them out
        yourself, for if I have to do it I am afraid that I shall show myself
        a very rough tirewoman.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spirit of
        Ruth, the same that had dwelt of old <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        man’s insolent audacity. She seized a half-burnt brand from the fire
        and stood on her defence. The soldier, thinking that he had found an
        easy prey, approached. But he had not reckoned on an ally who was
        ready to help her in her need. Jael had been woke by the voices, and
        watched with glaring eyes the soldier’s movements, uttering every now
        and then a low growl, which, however, the man was too much occupied
        to heed. As soon as he came within reach, she sprang upon him from
        her lurking-place. The force with which she threw herself upon him
        overset him, and he fell backwards, his head striking on the
        mill-stone which formed part of the scanty furniture of the cave. In
        a moment her fangs were in his throat. In vain did Ruth, who saw the
        man’s danger and was unwilling that he should perish in his sins,
        call her by her name. All the savage instinct in her was roused by
        the taste of blood. Before two minutes had passed the freebooter was
        dead.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the weeks went
        by fugitives continued to arrive at the little asylum which Seraiah
        and Azariah had founded among the hills. There was not one of them
        but brought with him some dismal story of the cruelty of the heathen
        and the renegades who acted as their instruments, and of the
        sufferings of the faithful. We should weary our readers were we to
        relate them in their monotony of horror. One will suffice, for it is
        the most famous as it is the most tragic of all the tales of that
        reign of terror.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One night the
        sentinels, whom the chiefs of the little colony were always careful
        to post, heard the sound of approaching footsteps. They challenged
        the new comer, and bade him stand, and tell them his errand. He could
        not articulate his answer, so spent was he with fatigue and distress;
        but it was evident that he was harmless, a mere youth, solitary, and
        unarmed. Unwilling to disturb the little colony at so late an hour—it
        was indeed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg
        136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>past
        midnight—the sentinels bade the stranger rest before their
        watch-fire. He was so exhausted and weary that he could swallow but
        very little of the food which his entertainers offered him. A few
        mouthfuls of barley cake, and a draught of milk more than satisfied
        him. Then he sank down on the ground overpowered with sleep, and his
        hosts wrapped him in a cloak and left him to his repose. Yet, wearied
        as he was, his slumbers were broken. Again and again he started up
        with a cry of horror on his lips. Those who listened to him felt sure
        that he must be going over in his dreams some dreadful scenes which
        he had witnessed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day he
        could scarcely be recalled to consciousness. Indeed it was judged
        well to leave nature to recover herself. The women of the colony took
        it in turns to watch by his side, and were ready, when he awoke for a
        few moments, with a cup of milk, the only thing which he seemed to
        relish. By degrees his slumbers grew more peaceful, and on the
        morning of the second day after his arrival he woke calm and
        collected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was Ruth who
        then happened to be on duty at his side. When he saw her, he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lady, I have a story to tell, and the chief
        of this place should hear it. Let him make haste to come, for I feel
        that I cannot rest while it is untold.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth sent one of
        her children to fetch her husband. The stranger refused to postpone

        them, the eldest being some thirty-and-three years of age, and the
        youngest twenty; but my father that is dead was the first-born. On
        the first day of the month, coming home about the eleventh hour from

        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> answered the lad, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but they do it by stealth, for the reading of the Law is

        Philip the Phrygian in the house, Philip himself being there. They
        had set forth a table in the court of the house, whereon they had
        placed abominable flesh. My uncles were standing bound, guarded by
        soldiers, and with them was my grandmother. Then said the Governor,
        Philip, to the eldest of the seven, whose name was Judah,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Pleasure me, my friend, by eating this
        excellent meat; ’tis of the most savoury, believe me.’</span> My
        uncle Judah answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I cannot obey thee in
        this matter, for it is forbidden by the Law.’</span> Philip said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Maybe he lacks an appetite. Give him that
        which shall sharpen his taste.’</span> Thereupon the executioner
        stepped forth with his lash, and gave him ten stripes. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Dost feel hungry now?’</span> said the Governor.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘I had sooner starve,’</span> said Judah,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘than eat the abominable thing.’</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nay,’</span> cried the Governor,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘miscall not the good things which are
        provided for you at the charge of thy lord the King.’</span> Then he
        said to the executioner, <span class="tei tei-q">‘This fellow uses
        not his tongue for any good purpose, but only to rail against my
        lord. Cut it out, therefore.’</span> So they cut the tongue out of my
        uncle’s mouth; and after that they cut off his hands and his feet.
        And afterwards, he being yet alive, they put him in a pan and burnt
        him over the fire. Then the Governor said to the second in age, whose
        name was Eleazar, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ah! friend, like you this
        better than the swine’s flesh? You may have your <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>choice, if you will.’</span> But he
        answered nothing. Then they tortured him most cruelly till he died.
        And so they did to all, one after the other. What they did I cannot
        bear to tell; nor, indeed, do I know the whole truth, for when three
        had perished in this manner I fainted for the horror of the thing;
        nor did I come to myself till the sixth was ready to suffer. Him I
        heard say these words to the Governor—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Be not
        deceived, or think that our God has abandoned us. He has given us
        over to your hand because we have offended against Him; nor do we
        suffer beyond what we have deserved. But as we have not escaped the
        punishment of our sins, so neither will you, but will perish
        miserably!’</span> After this he did not speak another word; nay, nor
        give a sign of pain, but stood steadfast and unmoved.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When there was but one of the seven left alive, Benjamin
        by name, the Governor seeing him, and, I take it, having some pity on

        "tei tei-q">‘Young man, you see how all these have perished
        miserably, because of their pride and obstinacy. Learn, then, by

        riches, more than you can desire, and promote you to honour, if you
        will humour my lord the King in this small matter.’</span> Benjamin

        God.’</span> Then Philip said to the mother of the seven,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Persuade him, for I would not have you left
        childless, if there is any help. These your sons were stout fellows,
        and could have done good service for my lord if they had been better
        advised; and I would fain save this one that is left. Reason with
        him, then, that he save his life, and that you be not wholly
        bereaved.’</span> Then the woman said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Trust
        me, my lord; I will reason with him.’</span> Then Philip smiled and
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Your wisdom comes somewhat
        late’</span>; and he whispered to one that stood by, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘You see that I have prevailed at last.’</span> But the
        man shook his head. Then the woman said to her son, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘O, my child, have pity on me, for I bore for you the
        pangs of childbirth, and spent on you the labour of nurture, bringing
        you up to this age. Repay me, therefore, for all that I have
        done.’</span> Then she paused awhile, and those that stood by
        scarcely knew what was in her heart. But the young man said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Mother, how shall I repay you?’</span> And
        she answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘By remembering that the Lord
        made heaven and earth, and all that is therein. Depart not from His
        Law, nor forget Him. Heed not this tormentor, who has power over your
        body for a short moment; but stand steadfast, as your brethren have
        stood steadfast; so shall I receive you with them into the
        everlasting glory.’</span> Then the young man smiled, as a bridegroom
        might smile when the veil is lifted from the face of his <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bride, and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Fear not, my mother; so it shall be, the Lord helping
        me.’</span> As for the Governor, he was mad with rage, and cried to
        the executioner, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Smite him, and this fool
        also.’</span> And the man, who indeed, I take it, was weary of his
        work, smote the youth and mother, and killed them, dealing each but
        one blow. So they escaped the torture.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the following
        Sabbath Seraiah read to the congregation the story of the Three
        Children in the fire, and then delivered a stirring address on the
        faith and courage of the heroic mother and her sons. The people
        listened with a breathless attention, and when he had finished, drew,
        so to speak, together that deep sigh of relief which tells the
        speaker that he has been holding the hearts of his hearers. He was
        one of those trustful souls who amidst all dangers find their
        strength in quietness and confidence. But the other leaders of the
        settlement could not help feeling somewhat anxious as to the future.
        What was to be the end? This constancy under suffering was grand
        beyond all praise; but were they and their brethren to stand still
        and see the religion of their fathers trampled out in blood? Was
        there no one to strike a blow for their faith and their fatherland?
        For they could measure the average strength and depth of human
        nature, and knew that there are ten who are ready to do and dare for
        one who can suffer and be strong. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you

        line crumbled away while we had to stand still as a target for the
        Edomite arrows, and how it grew solid again in a moment when our
        general gave the signal to charge? One was ready before to think that
        half the men were cowards, and then one could almost have sworn that
        there was not a coward among them. Yes, Azariah, we must strike when
        the time comes; but when the time will come is more than I can
        tell.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day
        brought an answer to his question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people were
        dispersing after the usual morning prayer when a stranger was seen
        hurrying up the pass. Arrived at the top, where a party of the men
        had gone to meet him, he threw himself breathless on the ground; at
        the same time he drew a small piece of folded parchment from the
        pouch which was fastened to his girdle, and handed it to one of the
        men. It ran thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mattathias to Seraiah, in
        the wilderness of Bethaven, greeting. Listen to the young man who
        brings this present without doubting, for he is faithful, and speaks
        words of truth.”</span> In a few moments Seraiah appeared. By this
        time the messenger had recovered his breath, and was ready to tell
        his tale.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What news bring you?”</span> said Seraiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Great news; for the Lord has smitten His <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enemies hip and thigh by the hand of
        Mattathias, son of Asmon, and by the hand of his sons.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A murmur of
        delight ran through the little audience, and every eye brightened at
        the prospect of action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tell on. We hear!”</span> cried Seraiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“May I crave a drink of water? for the way is long, and I
        have been travelling since the sun set yesterday.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The water was
        fetched. When he had quenched his thirst, young Asaph—that was the
        messenger’s name—began his story.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You know Mattathias, the son of Asmon, and the five
        young men, his sons, how they dwelt at Modin? Two months since,
        Philip the Phrygian—may the Lord cut him off in his sins!”</span> and
        the speaker paused, and spat upon the ground to emphasize his
        disgust. <span class="tei tei-q">“This Phrygian, then, sent one of
        his officers two months since to build an altar to one of the false
        gods before whom these children of perdition bow down. So the altar
        was built, none hindering, for the people were without a leader. This
        being finished, the Governor’s officer proclaimed a sacrifice and a
        feast to one of the demons whom these heathen worship. I know not the
        evil thing’s name, and if I knew it, would not take the accursed word
        upon my lips. On the appointed day there was a great gathering of the
        inhabitants of Modin. It was about the tenth hour <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>when the Governor’s deputy came, with his
        trumpeters and a small company of soldiers—it may be a score. When he
        had taken his seat the ministers brought up the ox that was for the
        sacrifice, a great beast, altogether white; and they had gilded his
        horns and put garlands of flowers about his neck, as their custom is.
        Then the deputy called to one Menahem, a usurer that dwelt in the
        village, and one of those who would sell their souls for a shekel.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Menon,’</span> he said—for they had changed
        his name after their fashion to one of their own tongue—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Menon, come forth, and do your office.’</span> And then
        he turned to the people, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hearken
        to me, ye Jews. This Menon here, who is known to all of us, has been
        promoted to great honour, for my lord Philip, who is the lieutenant
        of the Divine Antiochus, has made him priest. Honour him henceforth
        accordingly. And be sure also that if you are obedient, and give up
        your own dull and senseless superstition, and worship henceforth as
        the King commands, it shall be well with you and your
        children.’</span> When he had ended, the fellow approached the altar,
        and cut some hairs from the forehead of the beast, and sprinkled some
        meal mingled with salt between its horns. And it chanced, or, I
        should rather say, it was ordered of the Lord, that as the man did
        this Mattathias and his sons passed by on the outskirts of the crowd.
        And when he perceived the abominable thing that was being done, and
        that he who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
        145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>did
        it was a Jew, his spirit was moved within him. Then he ran forward,
        he and his sons with him. And when they were come into the space
        before the altar the old man cried, <span class="tei tei-q">‘He that
        is on the Lord’s side come hither!’</span> And some threescore of the
        people that were there came to him, and the rest stood still, and did
        nothing, for they knew that the sons of Asmon were mighty men of
        valour. As for the deputy and his soldiers, they were astonished
        beyond measure, and before they came to themselves some of the
        company of Mattathias rushed upon them and disarmed them. But
        Mattathias himself, with Judas his son, laid hold on Menahem. Then
        that miserable creature fell on his knees and begged for pardon,
        saying that he had done this thing on compulsion. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Nay,’</span> said Mattathias, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘the compulsion was of thy own evil and greedy heart.
        Thou hast sinned beyond all mercy of man; but the mercies of the Lord
        are past all measure. Die thou must; but I would have thee die in the
        faith of a son of Israel.’</span> Then the poor wretch—I had never
        thought to pity him, for he turned my own mother, when she lay dying,
        on to the public road, but no one could have refused him pity
        then—the wretch, I say, repeated with a stammering tongue,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one
        Lord.’</span> And now he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I give thee
        for thy prayers to the All-Merciful, till the shadow of this staff
        come so far,’</span> and he planted a staff in the ground. And
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146"
        id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>when the time was spent, the
        old man took his sword, and sheared off the wretch’s head with one
        blow. I had not thought that there was such strength in his arm. Then
        they brought the deputy and his soldiers to Mattathias. First he
        dealt with the deputy. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Slay him,’</span> he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘for he has made the people of the Lord
        to transgress.’</span> So they slew him. Then they made the soldiers
        stand before him. Four out of their number were Jews. These he
        commanded to be slain, after giving them the same grace that he had
        given to Menahem. To the others he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘You
        have not sinned as these your fellows, for you were born in darkness.
        Take, therefore, your choice: depart, and take good heed not to fall
        into our hands again, for, if you so fall, you die without further
        mercy; or, if ye will, stay with us. Only you must follow our ways,
        so far as it is commanded that the stranger should follow
        them.’</span> Half chose to depart, and half to stay.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“After this, Mattathias chose some of the young men to go
        as messengers to the villages round about, and carry the tidings of
        what had been done, and to say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord
        hath lifted up His ensign; gather yourselves together unto
        it.’</span> Also he appointed a place where they should meet—that is
        to say, Michmash.”</span></p>

        was much rejoicing in the little colony. No one, indeed, deceived
        himself with the thought that he could look forward to easy and
        pleasant days. All knew perfectly well that a time of struggle and
        suffering was before them. But there was hope. The darkness had
        parted, and they saw a far-off gleam of light. At the least they
        would have the chance of striking a blow for their country and their
        God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three days passed
        before Mattathias and his sons arrived; but when they came, they
        brought with them a considerable force. The news of the events at
        Modin had spread like wildfire through southern Judæa, and hundreds
        who had endured the rule of the heathen with ill-concealed impatience
        flocked to the standard of revolt. It was a strange array that might
        have been seen making its way up the mountain pass. A professional
        soldier would certainly at the first glance have thought meanly of
        its fighting capacities. Scarcely a score of the whole multitude was
        properly armed. Old weapons that had hung unused for a century or
        more had been taken down that they might strike another blow for the
        God of Israel. There had not been time to rub the rust from the
        sword-blades and the spear-heads, much less to hammer out upon the
        anvil the dents and notches left by the half-forgotten battles in
        which they had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
        149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>last
        been used. But it was only a few who had even these antiquated
        weapons. Most of the fighting men were armed as their fathers had
        been under the domination of the Canaanites in the days of Barak, or
        of the Philistines in the days of Saul. They carried mattocks and
        hoes, pruning-hooks and reaping-hooks tied to the ends of poles, or
        stakes shod with iron or even only hardened in the fire. But a nearer
        inspection would have changed the contempt of the military critic
        into something like admiration. These men had all that goes to the
        making of the soldier except the arms, and this want, after all, is
        the easiest to be supplied. They had on their faces the set, stern
        look of those who are fighting for a cause, and that a cause very
        near to their hearts. There were old men among them; but most were in
        the full vigour of youth and manhood. A real leader of men would have
        preferred to be followed by them than by the most handsomely equipped
        army of mercenaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the head of the
        column walked the aged Mattathias. Two of his sons, John and Judas,
        were with him, the other two being busy with the multifarious duties
        which fell upon the leaders of a force as yet so imperfectly
        organized. The old man—he had passed the threescore years and ten
        which are more commonly the limit of human existence, among the
        short-lived races of the East than among ourselves—had been carried
        in a litter for part of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg
        150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>way.
        This he had left at the entrance of the pass, being anxious not to
        give an impression of weakness. He now walked erect and with a firm
        step, his indomitable spirit supplying for the time all that was
        wanting in his physical strength. Nothing could be more enthusiastic
        than the reception which met him when he reached the little colony
        among the hills. He was the champion for whom they had been looking,
        and they received him as if he had been an <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“angel of God.”</span> Azariah and Seraiah, who had been
        hitherto informal leaders, gladly resigned their power into his
        hands, and from thenceforwards acted under his orders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was indeed
        much to do. The little post in the mountains was now to become a
        fortress, garrisoned by an army which was already considerable in
        numbers, and which daily increased in strength. Faithful Jews from
        all parts of the country flocked to the place which seemed the last
        refuge of patriotism and faith. Nor were there wanting less
        respectable adherents. There was not a few men who, like Benjamin and
        Shallum, had followed a life in which right and wrong, good motives
        and bad, were curiously mixed up and confounded. They were divided
        between patriotism and robbery—divided, of course, in very varying
        proportions. None were quite blameless, and none were quite bad. The
        most unprincipled had lurking somewhere in his heart a real regard
        for his country, and, to say the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>least, he found much more satisfaction in
        emptying the pockets of a heathen than in robbing his own people. The
        most honest, on the other hand, could not always guide his actions by
        any strict rule of integrity. He had to live, and if his enemies did
        not furnish him with the means, he must get them from his friends.
        Many of these men were genuinely attracted by the new movement,
        genuinely glad to lead a life which their consciences could heartily
        approve. Others found that their occupation was gone, and that they
        must enlist in the new patriot army or starve. The garrison thus
        gained a considerable number of recruits, but some of them were of a
        class that was likely to give no little trouble in the future.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In strong contrast
        with these doubtful adherents, and yet, in some respects, even more
        difficult to control, were the Chasidim—the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“religious,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“mighty men
        and voluntarily devoted to the Law”</span>—the spiritual ancestors of
        the Pharisees of a later time, but actuated by a zeal far more
        sincere than what could commonly be found in their degenerate
        descendants. Men braver it would not have been possible to find;
        their courage amounted to something like recklessness; but they were
        enthusiasts, and held their tenets with a tenacity that sometimes
        made discipline almost impossible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An incident that
        occurred soon after the arrival of Mattathias and his sons exhibited
        these difficulties in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg
        152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        striking way. The scene of it was the extreme right of the position,
        where Abiathar, one of the Chasidim, an able soldier but a most
        uncompromising zealot, was in chief command. The whole of the
        population had assembled to take part in a Sabbath service. They had
        listened to the great chapter in Deuteronomy which proclaims the
        blessings that will follow obedience, the curses that will fall on
        those who disobey. They had sung together that Psalm <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for the Sons of Korah,”</span> which tells of triumph
        and of shame, in which Israel now thanks Him who has saved them from
        their enemies and now complains that He has made them a reproach to
        their neighbours’ scorn, and a derision to them that are round about.
        And they were listening to a stirring exhortation to quit them like
        men and be strong, from the soldier-priest who was in chief command,
        when an alarm was raised that the enemy were at hand. Some of the
        younger men were on the point of running to fetch their weapons, for
        they were of course unarmed, when the stern voice of their leader
        called them back. <span class="tei tei-q">“Have you so soon forgotten
        the blessing and the curse which the Lord your God hath set before
        you? Has He not commanded you to keep holy the Sabbath-day, and will
        you profane it by smiting with the sword?”</span> They obeyed the
        command, though not without some murmurs from those who had not been
        thoroughly schooled in the stern tenets of the Chasidim. Meanwhile
        the enemy, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
        153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>strong force that had been sent out from the
        garrison at Jerusalem, had come up. A herald from the officer in
        command approached, and delivered a message in these terms:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Philip the Governor, and Apollonius, captain of the
        King’s army, bid you come forth from your hiding-place and deliver
        yourselves up. Let your former transgressions against the King
        suffice, and do now according to his commandment. So will he have
        mercy upon you, and admit you to his grace.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer of the
        Jewish commander was brief and decisive: <span class="tei tei-q">“We
        will not come forth, neither will we do according to the King’s
        commandment.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then followed one
        of the strangest scenes recorded in history. The peremptory refusal
        of the proffered terms was followed in a few minutes by a shower of
        missiles from the hostile force. The crowd at which they were aimed
        made no attempt at resistance, or even at escape. They fell where
        they stood, without lifting a hand, almost without uttering a cry.
        There is no greater trial of an army’s discipline than to make it
        stand and see its ranks thinned without being able to strike a blow
        in return. But the soldiers who endure this trial endure it in the
        hope of an hour that cannot be long delayed, when they shall reap the
        reward of their patience in an assured victory. The Chasidim who
        followed Abiathar had no such support in their endurance. They stood
        like sheep for the slaughter, strong men <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>as they were, and conscious that they could save
        themselves if they would. Not a stone did they throw in reply to the
        missiles that were showered upon them; and when the hostile ranks
        closed in, not till after some wondering delay, and began to finish
        the bloody work with their swords, they still held their ground with
        the same passive, unresisting courage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To one man at
        least the sword of the heathen brought that day a welcome release
        from his troubles. Shallum, the wine-seller of Jerusalem, had been
        consumed with remorse for the part which he had taken on the day when
        he followed <span class="tei tei-q">“Bacchus and his reeling
        train.”</span> The words haunted his mind with maddening repetition.
        The stern doctrines of the Chasidim had exercised a singular
        attraction for him, and though, stained as he was with sins for which
        he could scarcely hope purification, he did not even propose to join
        their ranks, he was a diligent attendant at their services and an
        attentive listener to their teaching. This day he had stood on the
        outskirts of the crowd, hearing with a rapt attention the promises
        and denunciations of the Law, and listening to, though not daring to
        join in, the chanted psalms. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Perhaps,”</span> he said to himself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the sound of the holy music will rid me of that accursed
        Bacchic chant which rings for ever in my ears.”</span> For a moment,
        when the massacre began, that love of life which even the most
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155"
        id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>miserable scarcely ever loses
        rose up strong in his heart. But he crushed it down. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have transgressed too often,”</span> he thought to
        himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“the commandment of the Lord; let me
        obey it at least this once, though I die.”</span> The next moment the
        stroke of a Greek sword levelled him to the ground, and the Bacchic
        chant vexed him no more.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not a single man
        of all that company—so strong was the contagion of enthusiasm among
        them—made any effort to escape the fate that overtook his companions.
        Still there was left a survivor to carry to Mattathias the news, at
        once so terrible and so glorious, of that day’s doings. One of the
        men had been felled to the ground by the blow of a stone at the first
        discharge of the enemy’s missiles, and had been left for dead upon
        the field. When he came to himself, late in the night, he found
        himself the only living being among masses of the slain. His first
        duty was obviously to carry tidings of the events to the
        commander-in-chief, and he made his way to head-quarters as quickly
        as his enfeebled condition permitted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mattathias saw
        that this question of the Sabbath must be settled at once, and, if
        the war was to be carried on with any prospect of success, settled on
        the side of freedom. He called a council in the early morning of the
        next day—the news had reached him about two hours after midnight. His
        five sons were present, as were Azariah, and Seraiah, with
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156"
        id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>others who held command in the
        patriot army. A long debate followed, for some of the Chasidim still
        clung to their rigid opinions, even in the face of the disaster which
        had happened, and the manifest probability, even certainty, of its
        happening again. They answered with stern iteration to each appeal
        that was made to them by the advocates of reason and moderation,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt keep holy the
        Sabbath-day.”</span> It was impossible to yield to them, and yet,
        such was their courage and devotion, almost equally impossible to
        break with them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mattathias, who
        presided at the assembly, had left the debate to other speakers, and
        had contented himself with keeping the peace between them, as far as
        he could. At last he rose and delivered his opinion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Brethren,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“let
        us take heed that we break not the Law while we seem to keep it. The
        Lord hath commanded us that we shall not work our own works or do our
        own pleasure upon His day. Shall we take occasion thereby to neglect
        His work and leave undone His pleasure? The heathen have come into
        His inheritance and devoured it. Shall we suffer them to usurp it for
        ever? Say, too, ye that will not stretch out a finger to save the
        people of the Lord from destruction because it is the Sabbath, do ye
        not reach out your hand to save a brother or a sister or a neighbour,
        yea, even a stranger upon that day, if it so chance that they be
        overtaken by some instant need? Nay, more; do ye not pull
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157"
        id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>out an ox or an ass, if it be
        fallen on that day into a pit? and will ye not pull out the Lord’s
        people from the pit which the malice of their enemies shall have
        digged for them? Listen, therefore, to my sentence. If the enemy come
        upon us upon the Sabbath we will beat him back, God helping.
        Nevertheless, if it may be so without damage to the Lord’s cause, we
        will not march against him on that day. If there be sin in this
        matter let it be upon me and my children.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And as he spoke
        the five young men, his sons, rose up in their places, and answered,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Amen</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The decision was
        generally accepted and acted upon, though to the last some of the
        more determined of the Chasidim avoided, as far as was possible, all
        military action on the Sabbath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rule of
        Sabbath observance was, however, still very strictly kept. It was two
        or three days after the council described above had been held, when
        one of the half-bandit, half-patriot recruits was discovered busily
        employed in cleaning his armour on the Lord’s day. He was kept in
        confinement till sunset, when the Sabbath was considered to end; a
        council of war was hastily summoned to hear the case. The man pleaded
        the recent decision of Mattathias, which had, he said, relaxed the
        law of the Sabbath. It was answered to him that the cleaning of
        armour was no necessary work, and that the distinction must now be
        kept more strictly than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
        158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>before, lest the people should fall into sin. He
        then urged that his offence was an error, and might be atoned for by
        a sin-offering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Alas! my son,”</span> said Mattathias, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Temple is profaned; nor can there be any more either
        sin-offering or peace-offering till it be purified. You must bear
        your iniquity yourself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John the soldier,
        who was unwilling that the army should lose one whose offence, after
        all, had only been an excess of military zeal, and Simon, whose
        gentle soul always was inclined to the milder course, voted for a
        lighter punishment than death, but they were overruled. Even Judas
        voted against them, knowing that such an army as theirs could only be
        held together by the bond of an enthusiastic faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give the glory to God,”</span> said the aged president
        of the Court, when he had communicated his sentence to the prisoner,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and take your death patiently, knowing that
        though you be judged according to men in the flesh, you shall live
        according to God in the spirit.”</span> The man bowed his head in
        submission, and repeated the confession of faith, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one
        Lord.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some weeks had
        necessarily to pass before the patriot army could assume the
        offensive. Some kind of drill was necessary, though Judas, who had
        the chief direction of military affairs, did not attempt to teach his
        men any elaborate manœuvres. But practice in sword-play and in
        shooting with the bow was diligently attended to. A corps of slingers
        was also formed under the command of one Sheba, a Benjamite, who
        possessed that skill with his weapon which was characteristic of his
        tribe. The sling was admirably suited to the kind of warfare which
        they would have to wage. As long as there were stones there would not
        be wanting missiles for the slings, while the supply of arrows would
        be likely to fall short, and could not easily be renewed. Meanwhile
        some rude anvils had been fitted up, and every one who could work as
        a smith was pressed into the service of repairing old arms or making
        new ones. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
        160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>By
        degrees many of the fighting men obtained an equipment which, if not
        very handsome, was at least fairly effective. Some of the new
        arrivals, too, were old soldiers, and brought their arms with them.
        Jews who had enlisted in the armies of the various Asiatic kings
        flocked to the standard of independence, when once it had been set
        up. Even some of the well-paid mercenaries who formed the bodyguard
        of Antiochus were patriotic enough to prefer to their luxurious
        existence the privations of life among the mountains. It was a life
        which, at the least, they could lead without offence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was winter when
        Mattathias and his sons reached the mountains; and with the first
        beginnings of spring the force under his command, now increased to a
        respectable strength, commenced active operations. These were
        extended over a considerable range of country to all the villages
        that had submitted to the edicts of the heathen rulers of the land.
        Even fortified towns, in several instances, were surprised, not, it
        may be guessed, without the connivance of the patriotic party within
        the walls. The idol altars which the King’s commissioners had set up
        were thrown down with every circumstance of indignity. All stores
        belonging to the usurping government were confiscated for the use of
        the national forces. But private property was respected. Arms,
        indeed, if they were likely to be useful, were taken, but always
        taken at a price.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
        161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Severe as was the
        discipline, it met with a cheerful submission from the men, so
        commanding was the influence exercised by their leaders. Conspicuous
        among them were, of course, the sons of Mattathias. All were
        favourites, but Judas and Simon took the lead. The strength, the
        skill, and the daring of the first were such that he was absolutely
        idolized by his troops. There was no task, however perilous, which
        they would not attempt under his guidance, for there was nothing
        which he did not seem capable of achieving. His physical strength was
        enormous; and his fertility of resource unfailing. He had always some
        new device for outwitting the enemy; and when the crisis of an
        undertaking arrived, if an attacking party were to be helped up some
        almost inaccessible height, a gate to be broken open by main force,
        or a pass to be held against overwhelming odds, Judas was always
        ready and always, it seemed, successful. Scarcely less honoured,
        though in a different way, was the prudence and kindliness of Simon.
        If Judas never failed in an attempt it was, in part at least, because
        Simon’s advice was so uniformly sagacious, because he could measure
        so exactly the means at their command. And when the fighting was
        over, no one could be more unwearying in his attentions to the
        wounded. The voice which rang so loud and clear through the din of
        battle was now soft and caressing, and the touch <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of his hand was as gentle and tender as if
        it had been a woman’s.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such leaders could
        do anything with their troops, even when they had to task their
        obedience by the infliction of punishment. Even such men as the
        ex-robber Benjamin felt what may be called the infection of
        discipline. He had accompanied one of the expeditions, in which a
        select force of patriots, after marching forty miles within
        twenty-four hours, surprised a squadron of Greek cavalry in one of
        the towns of Galilee. A short but sharp conflict took place in the
        square of the town, and Benjamin had borne himself with conspicuous
        courage. The struggle over, the soldiers had received entertainment,
        not in every case very willingly given, from the inhabitants of the
        town. Benjamin happened to be quartered upon a particularly churlish
        host, and resenting the coarse and scanty fare, so unsuited to the
        wealth apparent in all the fittings of the house, had revenged
        himself by abstracting a rich cloak belonging to his miserly
        entertainer. The article was stowed away on his own person, but the
        keen eye of one of the Chasidim officers espied it; the thief was
        denounced when the force had reached the encampment, and brought
        before the council, which was held under the presidency of Judas. The
        culprit pleaded in vain the shabby treatment which he had received.
        It was not for him, he was told, to take the law into his own
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163"
        id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hands. When he urged that the
        man was a traitor to his country he was asked whether he had himself
        taken the cloak from patriotic motives. <span class="tei tei-q">“Did
        you purpose,”</span> said Judas, going to the point with
        characteristic directness, <span class="tei tei-q">“to make this a
        common possession, or to take it for yourself?”</span> Benjamin
        faltered under this searching question, and had no answer to give.
        Then Judas pronounced his sentence: <span class="tei tei-q">“In old
        time he who had offended in this manner, as did Achan in the matter
        of the spoils of Jericho, died the death. These times are not equal
        to a justice so strict. But what the law enjoins that you will
        suffer. Were such sin as yours to go unpunished we could expect no
        blessing on our arms. We should become, not what we would be, the
        armies of the Lord, but a horde of robbers. You will receive forty
        stripes save one; if you offend again, you die.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without a murmur
        the culprit bared his shoulders for the lash. When the whip had once
        fallen Judas stayed the executioner’s hand. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Benjamin,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
        have done ill, but you have also done well. You saved from death our
        brother Seraiah as he lay wounded under the feet of the horsemen. For
        this good deed the rest of the punishment is remitted. Go, and sin no
        more.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seraiah indeed had
        been so seriously wounded that he had to be carried back to the camp
        on a litter rudely constructed of boards, and Ruth was now
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164"
        id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nursing him in the cave which
        had been originally set apart for their dwelling, and which they
        still retained. It was a miserable abode, though it at least afforded
        shelter from the rain. Indeed the lot of the women and children in
        the patriot encampment was full of suffering. The men had the
        constant excitement of their warfare to cheer them, but the women had
        only to toil and to endure. In the day the drought consumed them, and
        the frost by night. They had none of the comforts of life. Their food
        was coarse in the extreme, and often very scanty. But, perhaps, their
        greatest trial was in the matter of clothes. The stock which they had
        brought with them from their homes was, for the most part, worn out,
        and it was only on rare occasions, when some property of the heathen
        fell into the hands of the patriots, that any part of it could be
        replenished. Sheepskins and goatskins dried in the sun were commonly
        used, what remained of their wardrobes being reserved for special
        occasions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some time after
        the incident described above a serious trouble came upon Azariah.
        Miriam, his elder daughter, when she returned one day from her usual
        task of gathering herbs to eke out the family meal, complained of
        headache. It was evident that she was suffering from sunstroke. As
        the spring advanced the heat in some of the narrow mountain valleys
        became exceedingly oppressive, and the town-bred child felt it
        acutely. For some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
        165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>days
        her life was in danger, all the greater because she had neither
        medical attendance nor skilful nursing. Ruth did all she could for
        the little sufferer, but then Ruth had her own husband to attend to,
        for, though recovering from his wound, he needed much care, and her
        child was still too young to be left alone. One or two visits in the
        day was all that she could give. For the most part the girl’s father
        was her nurse, the little Judith giving such help as she could. Love
        gave a lightness and tenderness to his touch, and supplied the place
        of skill in that marvellous way which is so often possible to love.
        Day after day, as he sat by the bedside, and watched his charge, the
        girl’s face, now pale and wasted, and aged as it was with suffering,
        reminded him more and more of his lost Hannah. He lived over the
        happy past that they had known before the evil days began, the time
        when their first acquaintance as youth and maiden had ripened into
        love, and the early years of their wedded life. Thus he began to live
        in a world of imagination, while the sordid circumstances of the
        present seemed to make no impression upon him, though he always
        retained a punctual recollection of the duties that belonged to his
        attendance upon the sick.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day Ruth had
        come in to pay the daily visit for which, however engrossing her own
        occupations, she always contrived to find an opportunity. The
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166"
        id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>patient was in a sound sleep,
        with the little Judith for her sole attendant, Azariah having
        received an urgent summons to attend a council of war, in which some
        subject with which he was especially acquainted was to be
        discussed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a few
        minutes Azariah returned, but without any of the signs of agitation
        or haste that might be expected from one hurrying back to the
        performance of a duty that he had been compelled to neglect. His
        sister wondered to see him so calm, and she was still more surprised
        when he went on to say—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How like the child is growing to my dear
        Hannah!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth had often
        thought the same, but had not ventured to say so, for Azariah had
        never mentioned his dead wife.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> she answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        have often thought so.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have had some happy times of late. Before I could not
        get out of my mind the dreadful sight of her face when I last saw
        it.”</span> He paused for a moment, overpowered by the recollection,
        but soon resumed in a cheerful voice: <span class="tei tei-q">“But
        now in this dear child I seem to see her as she was in those happy
        Bethlehem days before our marriage, and again in the still happier
        time we had together in Jerusalem.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>our dear little Judith
        here.”</span> And he stroked the little girl’s head, and bade her go
        and play outside, but be careful not to go into the sun.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Believe me,”</span> he went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that when I am not here, Miriam’s angel is with her.
        Perhaps you will think me mad when I say that I have seen, and that
        not once or twice only, the flash of white garments vanishing in the
        darkness as I came into the cave. And last night, as I sat here,
        dreaming, it may be, but certainly seeing everything in the cave as
        plainly as I see it this moment, the angel came with the little
        babe—our little David that my Hannah took with her to Paradise—to
        kiss his sick sister. And when Miriam awoke about an hour after dawn,
        the fever had left her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment the
        girl opened her eyes. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, father,”</span>
        she cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“did you indeed see little brother
        last night?—for I saw him too; but I did not see that an angel was
        carrying him. He seemed to be in the air somehow, with no one holding
        him up. And he had beautiful white clothes—not these nasty sheepskins
        and goatskins that we have to wear—and he stretched out his hands to
        me, and kissed me, and I felt that moment as if that dreadful burning
        had gone out of me. And oh! there was such a wonderful look upon his
        face. It was just like the look on dear mother’s face that evening
        when the sun was just setting, and you took little brother up in your
        arms, and said his name was David.”</span></p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth could only
        listen to such talk with wonder and awe. But she went back to her
        husband and child with a lighter heart than she had borne for many
        days.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a trouble was
        at hand which, though it had been for some time foreseen, was great
        enough to make private sorrows and anxieties seem inconsiderable. It
        was reported through the encampment that Mattathias, the father of
        his people, was dying.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man’s
        health had been failing for some time. The hardships of his new life
        had told grievously upon it, all the more that he refused the
        exemption from labour which his age required. He had ceased to
        accompany the expeditions because he found that his presence hampered
        the movements of younger and stronger men, but the management of the
        multifarious affairs of the encampment—the home administration, as it
        may be called, of the patriotic movement—he kept in his own hands.
        Early and late he busied himself in this work, and before many weeks
        were past his labours wore him out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was well aware
        that the end had come, and that all that remained for him to do was
        to appoint a successor who should accomplish, or at least carry
        on—for he did not deceive himself as to the difficulty of the
        work—the task which he had commenced. All the leaders were summoned
        to his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name=
        "Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>presence, the wounded
        Seraiah, for whose capacity and serene courage the old chief had a
        high regard, being carried thither on a litter. The old man was
        propped in his bed on cushions, the difficulty of breathing making it
        impossible for him to lie down. On either side stood his five sons,
        John, the eldest, being at his right hand, with Eleazar and Jonathan
        near him, while Simon and Judas were on the left. A physician, the
        solitary professor of the healing art that the camp possessed, sat by
        the bed’s foot, with a cup of some cordial in his hand.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man began
        by laying his hand on John’s head. <span class="tei tei-q">“My
        son,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“for your loyalty and
        faithful obedience I thank the Lord that gave me so excellent a son
        for my first-born. You know what it is in my mind to do with respect
        to the succession of my work, and I am assured that you approve. But
        for the sake of those that stand by,”</span>—and he pointed to the
        assembled chiefs—<span class="tei tei-q">“I solemnly declare that for
        no defect of courage or honesty I pass you by. And say if you are
        content to leave it according to what seems best to my
        judgment.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said the faithful John, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am content.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simon beckoned to
        the physician, who handed the cup of cordial to the dying man. He
        swallowed a few drops, and then went on:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hear, my friends and brethren. In the distribution of my
        worldly goods I follow custom and law. The inheritance of my fathers
        I give to my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>eldest born, according to the custom of the
        birthright; and I direct that the younger shall have such portions as
        are due to them. But I have that to give which has been entrusted to
        me of the Lord, and with which I must deal according to His pleasure,
        so far as it is given to me to know it. Simon, I will that thou be
        the father of the people. Care for them as for thy children. Do
        justice between man and man. Strive to the utmost that they keep the
        Law of the Lord their God. He has given thee prudence and discernment
        and knowledge of the customs of our fathers. See that thou use these
        things for the glory of the Lord and the good of the people. Judas, I
        will that thou be captain of the host. Be stout and of a good
        courage, and the Lord shall fight on thy side, and give thee the
        victory. The end is not yet, and maybe thou wilt not see it with
        thine eyes; but, though it tarry, wait for it. <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then addressed
        a few words to the two other sons, words of mingled encouragement and
        advice. This done he stretched out his hands, and, with a voice of
        surprising firmness in one so weak, blessed the whole assembly,
        repeated the usual profession of an Israelite’s faith, and then drew
        his last breath without a struggle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas and his
        brothers sat late into the night consulting about a daring scheme
        which the new captain of the host proposed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It would be an unseemly thing,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that Mattathias, the son of Asmon, should be
        thrust into a hole among the rocks as if he were an outcast or a
        robber. Verily we will bury him with his fathers in the sepulchre of
        Asmon.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Twill be no easy matter to contrive,”</span> said
        Jonathan, the man of many devices. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        sepulchre is hard by the town, and we can scarcely avoid the eyes of
        the people in coming and going.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, Jonathan, I have no purpose of doing the thing in
        secret. It would not be well to bury my father by stealth in his own
        sepulchre. It shall be done openly, and before the eyes of
        men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The brothers, bold
        men as they were, were aston<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
        172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>ished at the hardihood of the plan. But their
        respect for the genius of Judas silenced any opposition. And then he
        had never failed in any enterprise. John was the first to speak.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis well thought of, Judas. Lead the way, and I
        follow;”</span> and he clasped his brother’s hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The captain then
        developed his plan, which, when examined, seemed less audacious than
        it had appeared at first sight. It was to be a surprise, and the very
        unlikelihood of the attempt made its success more probable. Modin was
        not occupied by a garrison, and the townsfolk, even if their goodwill
        could not be counted on, would scarcely venture to resist. Only it
        would be necessary to act before any rumour of their intention could
        get about, and, the funeral march once begun, to hasten it to a
        completion as much as possible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The body was at
        once preserved against decay as far as the scanty means at the
        command of the patriots would allow. Then word was sent through the
        encampment that all who wished to take their last look at the dead
        hero must come at once. For three hours a constant stream of
        awestruck and weeping visitors passed through the tent in which he
        lay, attired in his priestly garb, the long white beard reaching
        almost to his waist, his wasted features settled into the majestic
        repose of death. Every visitor as he entered loosed his sandals from
        his feet, feeling that the place which he was entering was
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173"
        id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>holy ground. Every one, as he
        took his last look on the hero’s face, prayed to the God of his
        fathers that his last end might be like his. Women brought their
        children that they might kiss the hem of his garment. It would be a
        distinction to them in their old age that they had been privileged to
        pay this honour to Mattathias, the son of Asmon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before dawn the
        procession started. The body, in its rude coffin of wood, was placed
        upon a bier, thirty bearers taking it in turns to carry it. The
        thirty were divided into five relays of six, one of the sons of the
        dead being always among those who performed the duty. With the
        exception of a small force which was left for the protection of the
        women and children, all the fighting men of the settlement
        accompanied the body. In spite of the efforts which had been made to
        procure or manufacture arms, they were still but poorly equipped. Of
        military display, of the <span class="tei tei-q">“pomp and
        circumstance of glorious war,”</span> there was absolutely nothing.
        But the solid qualities of endurance and courage could be seen in
        their sinewy forms and resolute faces. To an observer who could look
        below the surface that squalid array had in it the capacity for
        achieving an heroic success.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas had been
        quite right in predicting that the expedition would meet with little
        or no opposition. Its march, indeed, was absolutely unmolested by the
        enemy. The movement was wholly unexpected, and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>consequently no force had been collected
        to hinder it; while the garrisons of the two or three fortified
        places which the army passed on its route did not feel themselves
        strong enough to attempt any attack. Already, though as yet no
        pitched battle had been fought, these Jewish <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ironsides”</span> had inspired their enemies with a
        wholesome dread of their prowess. Both Greeks and renegades knew that
        these ragged, ill-armed mountaineers stood as stoutly and plied their
        swords as fiercely as any soldiers in the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No incident
        occurred in the course of the march save one, which, though little
        thought of at the time, was destined to lead to events of
        considerable importance. When the first halt was called, Benjamin,
        who was a well-known personage in the neighbourhood, and who in
        spite, perhaps in consequence, of his antecedents enjoyed not a
        little popularity, found entertainment in the house of an old
        acquaintance. The man was a farmer, who had been accustomed to make a
        handsome profit by supplying the bandits with useful information.
        Recognizing his old accomplice in the ranks of the patriot army, he
        invited him into his house, and entertained him with his best.
        Unfortunately this best happened to be some salted swine’s flesh.
        Benjamin had some scruple about eating it; but it was not strong
        enough to resist the claims of a ravenous hunger, supported as they
        were by his entertainer’s ridicule. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>The meal was washed down by the contents of two
        or three flasks of potent wine, and the friends were so busily
        occupied with discussing these, and with talking over old times, that
        the signal for assembly passed unnoticed. Then followed a search for
        stragglers, and Benjamin was discovered with the fragments of his
        meal before him; and though his hunger had stripped the bones bare
        enough, no one could doubt what was the animal to which they had
        belonged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The offender had
        been caught, so to speak, red-handed, and some voices were raised to
        demand his instant execution. But the officer in command of the
        detachment interposed. In any case he would have objected to a
        proceeding of which Judas would certainly have disapproved, and he
        had besides a certain kindness for Benjamin, of whose courage and
        dexterity he had been more than once a witness. Accordingly the
        offender was put under close arrest, and the army resumed its
        march.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benjamin had no
        need to be told that he was in very serious danger. The Chasidim, at
        least, would be more ready to overlook fifty thefts than one
        transgression in the matter of unclean food; and he felt sure that if
        he could not contrive to escape before the army returned to the
        encampment, possibly before they reached Modin, his days were
        numbered. While he was meditating on the chances of escape, one of
        the escort, an associate of former days, was <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>thinking how he could help him. Happening to be
        in front of the prisoner, he purposely stumbled and fell. The
        prisoner fell over him, and in the confusion the soldier cut the
        cords that bound Benjamin’s hands. The prisoner was not a man to lose
        such an opportunity. Waiting till he reached a convenient spot on the
        march, he shook off his bonds, sprang to the side of the road, and,
        before his keepers could recover from their astonishment, was lost to
        sight in the woods which bordered it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the army
        reached Modin no attempt was made to interfere with its proceedings.
        Our old acquaintance, Cleon, had been sent to replace the
        commissioner killed when Mattathias raised the standard of revolt,
        and Cleon was far too careful of himself to risk his safety in any
        foolhardy struggle against superior strength. When the body of armed
        men was first seen approaching the town, he had supposed that its
        object was to possess itself of any money, arms, or provisions that
        might be found in the place. A nearer view showed the funeral
        procession, and one of the townspeople was acute enough to guess the
        real purpose of the expedition. Cleon’s resolve was at once taken. He
        would make the best of circumstances which he could not control.
        Accordingly he went out of the town with a flag of truce in his hand,
        and meeting the vanguard of the approaching array, demanded an
        interview with its leader.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was brought
        into the presence of Judas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And you, sir,”</span> continued the Greek, with
        elaborate courtesy, <span class="tei tei-q">“may I ask to whom I am
        speaking?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am Judas, son of Mattathias.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Allow me, then,”</span> answered Cleon, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to express my sympathy with you in the loss of so
        renowned a father, once, I believe, a distinguished citizen of this
        place, and to assure you that you will meet with no molestation in
        whatever honours you may see fit to render to his memory. I would
        myself willingly attend the obsequies, did I suppose that my presence
        would be welcome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We thank you, sir,”</span> said Judas, who was inwardly
        chafing at this hypocritical politeness, but disdained to show his
        feelings; <span class="tei tei-q">“we would sooner be
        alone.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cleon saluted and
        withdrew.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The funeral
        ceremonies were performed with an impressive solemnity. The stone
        which closed the entrance to the family tomb of the house of Asmon
        had been rolled away, and the dead body was placed in the niche which
        had been long ago prepared for its reception. Only the sons of
        Mattathias and a few <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
        178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        their best trusted counsellors and lieutenants entered the cave; the
        rest of the multitude stood without, waiting in profound silence till
        they should be told that the old warrior had been laid in his last
        resting-place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the cave had
        been closed again John, as the eldest son of the deceased, spoke a
        few words to the army.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We have buried our dead,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“out of our sight; but his memory lives and will live
        among us. Let us be true and faithful as he was, that we may be with
        him when he shall rise again at the last day, and sit down with
        Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob at the supper of the people of God.
        Meanwhile let us follow and obey him whom with his last breath he
        named as his successor. Long live Judas, son of Mattathias, son of
        Asmon, the captain of the host of the Lord!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And all the army

        up his courtesies by an invitation addressed to Judas and his
        principal officers, in which he begged the honour of their company at
        a meal. Judas declined the invitation, but intimated that he would
        gladly purchase a supply of corn. The commissioner, well aware that
        his guests could take by force anything that was refused to them, at
        once acceded to the request, and Micah was selected, on account of
        his familiarity with the Greek language, to conduct the

        ashamed to hang up in his shop. Is this the elegant Menander—I beg
        your pardon, the elegant Micah, who was once the very pink of

        winning a regular victory than a dove has of killing a kite. Come
        now, be reasonable; give up this silly affair, and be my guest, till

        not speak harshly to you for the sake of old kindnesses which I doubt
        not you meant well in showing me. But be sure that I am in earnest.
        The old things are hateful to me. I have other desires, other hopes;
        and if they are not satisfied, not fulfilled, I can at least die for

        crowd of ragamuffins, under a general—Apollo save the mark!—who has
        never seen a battle, can stand against the troops of the King. You
        used to be a very good fellow, Menander or Micah, or whatever you
        call yourself, but, as sure as you are sitting there, if you go on in
        this mad fashion, I shall have the pain of seeing you some day
        hanging on a cross.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the sound of
        the word the young Jew started as if he had been stabbed. It opened
        the way for a flood of memories which, for a while, carried him out
        of himself. When he could command himself sufficiently to speak, he
        burst out—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes—hanging on a cross! Nothing more likely if only you
        and your friends get their way. You talk <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of taste, and art, and beauty: you have always
        plenty of fine words on your tongues, but when it comes to practice
        you are as brutal as the fiercest of the savages whom you profess to
        despise—nay, you are ten times worse, for you know what you are
        doing. Now, listen to me, Cleon. Some six months ago I was walking
        through Jerusalem after your teachers of culture and art had been
        busy giving their lessons. What think you I saw? I saw a woman
        hanging on a cross, and her little son, a babe of a few days old,
        fastened about her neck. Thank God they were dead. Some one of your
        people had in mercy—for you are not altogether without
        mercy—strangled her before they fastened her to the cross. And what
        was her offence? Was she unchaste, a thief, a murderer? Not so; no
        purer, gentler soul ever lived on the earth. No, she had done for her
        son as her fathers for a thousand years and more had done for their
        sons. And this was how your prophets of refinement and beauty dealt
        with her. Cleon, that woman was my sister. Do you think that such
        deeds as that will go unpunished? Surely not; whether your faith—if
        you have a faith—or mine be true, there is a vengeance that
        follows—slow, it may be, but sure of foot—the men who work such
        wickedness. And, for my part, I doubt not who the first minister of
        that vengeance will be. You sneer at our general; he is no general at
        all, you think; a mere leader of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>vagabonds, who has never seen a battle. He will
        see many a battle, yea, and the back of many a foe, before his work
        is done. He is a very Hammer of God, and he will break his enemies to
        pieces. And now, Cleon, hearken again to me. You and I have broken
        bread together as friends. That is past for ever. May the God of my
        fathers send down upon me all the plagues that He holds in the vials
        of His wrath, if I have any truce with the enemies of His people! But
        with you, as I would not join hands in friendship, so I would not
        cross them in anger. Pray, therefore, to your gods, as I will
        certainly pray to Him whom I worship, that we may never see each
        other again. And now farewell!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The daring action
        of Judas at Modin was a defiance to the rulers at Jerusalem, and felt
        to be so, not only by them, but by the whole country. It was followed
        up by active operations on the part of the patriots against the
        smaller towns of south-eastern Palestine. The population began to
        feel that it was safer to be on the side of the patriots than against
        them. Thanks to this feeling, to the genuine favour with which the
        movement was regarded, and to the perfect system of scouts which he
        had organized, Judas had early and trustworthy information of all the
        movements of the enemy. Apollonius had made up his mind that he must
        act if he was not to lose entirely his hold upon the country, and set
        about organizing a force so overwhelmingly strong that it must, he
        thought, sweep the insurgents before it. This intention, and indeed,
        it may almost be said, every detail of his preparations, was
        communicated to Judas. He, on his part, was determined that a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185"
        id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heathen army should never again
        invade the mountain sanctuary. He would not await attack. His
        military instincts, which, indeed, were extraordinarily fine and
        true, warned him that boldness was now his best policy, and that he
        should go down and give battle to the enemy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was on the eve
        of the departure of the patriot army, when Seraiah might have been
        seen making his way back from a conference of the chiefs to the cave
        which served him as a dwelling. He was now recovering from his wound,
        but he was still too weak to support the fatigues of a march.
        Accordingly Judas had left him in command of the little garrison,
        scarcely, indeed, containing one able-bodied man, which was to
        protect the encampment. When he reached his home he found his nieces,
        Miriam and Judith, sitting with his wife, and watching the infant
        that was slumbering by her side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She prattled on
        without waiting for an answer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Father sees
        angels, and they bring him words from mother, where she is in
        Paradise. And, do you know, uncle, last night he had a wonderful
        dream about a sword? He told it to us this morning. He often tells us
        his dreams. Sometimes he seems as if he were talking to mother; and
        he says that Miriam is so like her.”</span></p><span class=

        that father says God sends abroad to do His errands—come flying down,
        and the angel had in his hand a great sword. And he stood by father’s
        bed, and showed him a name graven on the blade—it was the name which
        we may not speak, though it is part of father’s name<a id="noteref_8"

        he had done this he put the hilt in his hand and departed. Then
        father awoke, and found only his own old sword in his hand; and this,
        you know, is so hacked that it is not of much use, and is very weak,
        too, in the handle. Father never sleeps without it, and he must have
        drawn it out in his sleep, without knowing it, from under the pillow
        where he keeps it. But he says the dream will certainly come true.
        And now, Miriam,”</span> she went on, turning to her sister, for the
        little maiden was of the true housewife temper, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we must be going back to get father’s dinner ready for
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When they were
        left alone Seraiah said to Ruth, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is as I
        feared—I am to stay behind.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth felt a thrill
        of joy go through her, but was too wise a woman to show it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Old Reuben will not hear of my going. He says that I

        187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=

        battle that is to decide; for I am sure that as this battle goes, so
        will the end be. But I am to be in command of the garrison
        here.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“I should be ungrateful indeed if I did,”</span> said
        Seraiah, as he kissed her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        excitement in the camp had risen to fever heat. Scouts had come
        racing in at headlong speed with tidings that the enemy’s army had
        started from Jerusalem, and that it numbered not less than twelve
        thousand regular troops, well-equipped, and furnished with a
        formidable supply of the engines of war. The patriots were in that
        state of exaltation in which men make little of the numbers opposed
        to them, and the disparity of forces roused no apprehensions. If any
        such were felt they gave way to rage when the messengers added that
        the hated Apollonius himself was in command of the hostile army.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah and Micah
        were among a small company of chiefs who were standing outside the
        tent of Judas, and were discussing the prospects of the war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Surely the blood of my wife and my child cries against him from the

        next-of-kin to Hannah.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Surely,”</span> replied Azariah, with some heat,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“there is no kinship so close as the tie
        which binds husband to wife! ’Tis I that should be Hannah’s avenger
        of blood.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My brothers,”</span> broke in the voice of Judas, who
        appeared in the door of his tent, <span class="tei tei-q">“you think
        too much of your private wrongs. Great they are, I know—none greater.
        But is there one soldier in this army that has not lost wife, or
        child, or father, or brother by the hand of this evil man? We will
        go, one and all, as avengers of blood, and the Lord will deliver him
        into the hands of him whom He shall choose.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day the army
        set out. On the evening of the second day they came in sight of the
        forces of Apollonius. Some of the more fiery spirits were for an
        instant attack, but the prudence of Judas, which was not less
        conspicuous than his daring, restrained them. His men were wearied
        with a long day’s march, and they wanted food. And he himself had not
        had time to reconnoitre the enemy’s position or receive any
        intelligence from his scouts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early next day the
        battle began. In one sense Judas was greatly overmatched. The enemy
        were superior in numbers—almost in the proportion of four to one—and
        in equipment. But, on the other hand, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the Hebrew leader could rely implicitly on his
        soldiers. Anything that mortal man, inspired by zeal and the burning
        sense of wrong, could achieve, they might be trusted to do. To such a
        temper, of course, the policy of attack is best suited. Judas massed
        his best troops on his right wing, which happened to be opposed to
        what his eagle eye discerned to be the weakest part of the enemy’s
        line. Apollonius saw his intention, and commenced a movement of
        troops which was designed to strengthen the weak point in his array.
        But such a movement in the face of a hostile force cannot be carried
        out without confusion. Judas saw his opportunity, ordered his men to
        advance at the double, and closed fiercely with the foe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek line
        broke almost at once, and the chief danger now was that the
        conquerors might press on too eagerly. The Greeks were not an
        undisciplined mob which could be treated with contempt. Some of them,
        at least, were veteran soldiers, in whom the sense of discipline was
        an instinct, and who, if not very enthusiastic in the cause for which
        they were fighting, were perfectly well aware that their best chance
        of personal safety was to be found in keeping together and holding
        their ground. Judas, in whom native genius seemed to supply the want
        of experience, appreciated the enemy with whom he had to deal, and
        kept his own men well in hand, though he was careful not unduly to
        check their courage.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fortune of the
        day continued to declare in favour of the patriots; but Apollonius
        himself, surrounded by a picked force of mercenaries, still held his
        ground. Shortly after noon Azariah and Micah, who had kept close
        together during the battle, and had both performed prodigies of
        valour, gathering a company of their immediate followers, made a
        determined rush in his direction. The bodyguard, terrified by the
        fierceness of this onset, wavered and fled, leaving but three or four
        faithful attendants, who refused to leave their commander.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek
        recognized Azariah, and called to him by his name. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Azariah, if you think that I have wronged you, I do not
        refuse you the opportunity of revenge. Come out from your companions,
        and I will meet you alone. You are a brave man, and would not take a
        soldier at unfair odds.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah did not
        deign to answer; but one of his comrades replied, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dog of a heathen! you forget where you are. We are not
        contending in your foolish games: we are the avengers of blood—the
        innocent blood which you have shed; and we will slay you as men slay
        a venomous snake. Such equity as you have dealt to others, we will
        show to you. Was it in fair fight that you slew women and
        children?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apollonius looked
        on the ring of scowling faces that surrounded him, and saw that there
        was no mercy or even what he would have called the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>courtesy of war to be hoped from them.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I only wish,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that I had rooted out the whole cursed brood from the
        earth, and burnt the den of thieves which you call your city, and
        laid the shrine of the demon whom you call your God level with the
        ground!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Silence, blasphemer!”</span> cried Azariah, as he
        whirled his sword over his head.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not the
        almost worthless weapon, with its dented edge and broken hilt, that
        he had carried into the battle. Early in the day he had cut down a
        Greek officer, and taken the sword of the dead man in exchange for
        his own.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke he
        beckoned to his countrymen. They stood back, even Micah recognizing
        the right of the husband to strike the first blow at the murderer of
        his wife.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apollonius raised
        his sword to parry the stroke which he expected to be aimed at his
        head. With a rapid change of movement his adversary changed the blow
        into a thrust, and drove the point of his weapon through the Greek’s
        heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah was
        drawing out his weapon from the corpse, when Judas, who had been
        hastening to the spot not without some hope of himself crossing
        swords with the hated Apollonius, came up.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A mighty weapon that!”</span> he exclaimed, as the
        conqueror wiped the blade on the dead man’s tunic. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let me take it in my hands.”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He poised it and
        judged its balance, tried the edge, and then narrowly scanned the
        markings on the blade.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“how came
        you by this sword? I had observed”</span>—and indeed his eagle eye
        noted every detail—<span class="tei tei-q">“that yours was but a poor
        weapon, unworthy of your strength, and I wished to find something
        better for you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah told him
        how he had taken it from a Greek on the field of battle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And saw you this?”</span> he went on, pointing to the
        Holy Name which had been engraved on the blade. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Doubtless this belonged to some Hebrew warrior in time
        past, for the fashion of the letters is somewhat antique; the heathen
        whom you slew had taken it, and now the Lord has given it back into
        the hands of the faithful.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah then
        related his dream.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The angel whom you saw,”</span> said Judas, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“was, doubtless, the angel of battle, and the Lord has
        been faithful, as ever, to His promise.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He gave back the
        consecrated sword to Azariah, and took the weapon which was still
        grasped in the right hand of the dead Apollonius. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“With this,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        will fight as long as I live.”</span> And he broke out into the
        triumphal chant of the Psalmist—<span class="tei tei-q">“The ungodly
        have drawn out the sword, and have bent the bow to cast down the poor
        and needy. Their sword shall go through their own heart and their bow
        shall be broken.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
        patriots, bivouacking on the field of battle, slept the sound sleep
        of those who have fought a good fight, the women, left, with the
        children and the sick, in charge of a small guard, only strong enough
        to protect them against casual robbers, felt the most intense
        anxiety. Ruth in her cave, with the children slumbering by her side,
        watched through the night, listening intently to every sound. At one
        time she could hear the bats which haunted the rocks flapping and
        fluttering as they went out to take their flights in the night air.
        Then from farther away came the moaning of the jackals, as they
        hunted for their prey, with now and then the deeper note of a wolf,
        or the sound, so strangely like to mocking laughter, of the hooting
        owls. Everything at that moment seemed very dark and hopeless to the
        anxious wife.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg
        194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’Tis everywhere the same,”</span> she thought to
        herself—<span class="tei tei-q">“the stronger hunt and devour the
        weak. The lions roaring after their prey, do seek their meat from
        God. The lambs and the fawns are their prey, and God gives the
        helpless, innocent things into their jaws. And will he give us to the
        jaws of the heathen who are hunting us that they may devour us? Did
        He deliver the thousand who died that they might not profane His
        Sabbath? Not so. He suffered them to perish, to be a prey for the
        beasts of the field and the fowls of the air. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Verily our bones lie scattered before the pit, like as
        when one breaketh and heweth wood upon the
        earth.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And then her
        thoughts travelled to those who were especially close to her heart.
        Azariah and Micah—where were they? How had it fared with them in the
        battle? Were they lying on the field of battle with stark faces
        turned to the stars of heaven, and the vultures preying on their
        limbs? And she shuddered, and hid her face in the coarse coverlet
        under which she lay, as if she would shut out the dreadful picture
        that her thoughts had conjured up before her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When she opened
        her eyes again, there was a faint suspicion of light in the darkness
        of the cave. The bats came flapping back from the outer air to their
        haunts in the roof. Jael, the jackal, who had been for her nightly
        prowl came back with her cubs, and lay down in her accustomed corner.
        The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name=
        "Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>light grew rapidly
        stronger, and when Ruth stepped from the threshold of the cave into
        the fresh morning air, though the sun was not visible, its light had
        begun to touch the highest summits of the mountains.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking to the
        head of the pass Ruth could see her husband where he stood at his
        post of observation, a spot which commanded a distant view of the
        westward approaches to the encampment. As she watched him she
        observed him make a signal that indicated that he had to make some
        important communication. A moment afterwards she could see other men
        hurrying to the spot. She bade Miriam and Judith, who were always her
        guests during their father’s absence, watch the still sleeping
        infant, and made all the haste she could to join her husband. When
        she reached him she found the little group of watchers straining
        their eyes as they gazed at a body of armed men that could be seen in
        the distance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are they? foes or
        friends?”</span> was the question that was in every heart, though
        none ventured to put it into words.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the vanguard of
        the approaching force came to an eastward turn in the path, a ray of
        sunshine touched the helmets of the men and made them glitter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is this?”</span> said one of the men. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They went with caps of leather; whence come these
        helmets of brass and steel?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shudder went
        through the hearts of Ruth and of the other women who by this time
        had joined her. If the patriots had been overpowered, and these armed
        men were heathen murderers and ravishers come to wreak their
        vengeance on those who had been left behind——</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whence come they?”</span> said Seraiah. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They are the spoils of the heathen.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he spoke the
        distant sound of singing was carried by the wind up the pass, and
        though the words could not as yet be heard it was recognized at once
        as one of the Temple chants. The little band of sentries and women
        raised a joyful shout, and hurried down the pass to meet the new
        comers. And now the noble voice of Judas could be heard leading the
        song of triumph. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast girded me with
        strength unto the battle; Thou shalt throw down mine enemies under
        me. Thou hast made mine enemies also to turn their backs upon me; and
        I shall destroy them that hate me.... I will beat them as small as
        the dust before the wind.”</span> And now the good news had spread
        like wildfire through the camp. The rest of the women hastened down
        to meet and greet the deliverers, and among them Miriam and Judith,
        carrying Ruth’s infant child. The first thought of all was to do
        honour to the chief who had led the host of the Lord to victory. They
        kissed the hem of his robe, his hands, even his feet. It was only
        when they had satisfied <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg
        197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>these feelings of gratitude and reverence that
        they could think of private affections. And when the whole array, the
        women and children now mingling in the ranks with the armed men,
        reached the top of the pass, it halted for a few minutes. The name
        which Micah, in his talk with Cleon, had given to Judas had passed
        through the army, and had caught the popular fancy. There was
        scarcely a man among them but had seen him dealing death at every
        blow among the ranks of the heathen. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hail,
        Judah Maccâbah! Hail, Hammer of God!”</span> was the cry that went up
        from the assembled multitude. The title has been given in after times
        to other sturdy champions of the truth, notably to him who, in the
        Valley of Tours, turned back the tide of Paynim invasion;<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> but never
        has it been more honourably gained, or more worthily borne, than it
        was by Judas, the son of Mattathias.</p>

        <div class="tei tei-tb">
          &nbsp;
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great as was the
        exultation of the patriots over their victory, no one among them, and
        least of all their far-sighted general, deceived himself with the
        flattering notion that it had finished the war. Every one was well
        aware that the defeat and death of Apollonius was not only a disgrace
        that Antiochus and his lieutenants were bound to avenge, but a
        disaster that had to be repaired. It was with<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>out surprise, therefore, that Judas heard that
        Seron, Governor of Coele-Syria, was marching southwards over the
        great maritime plain known by the name of Sharon, with what rumour
        described as a vast host.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas at once
        resolved to repeat the policy which had been found so successful in
        the conflict with Apollonius. The enemy would soon reach the passes
        that led into the hill-country of Eastern Palestine; and it was there
        that he must be met. To allow him to make good this movement without
        opposition would be to throw away a great advantage. The Jewish
        commander resolved, accordingly, to dispute the possession of the
        pass. With a boldness which seemed to some of his followers to verge
        upon rashness, he left Jerusalem, occupied as it was by a hostile
        garrison, behind him, and marched westward till he reached the range
        which looks over the Plain of Sharon to the Great Sea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This strategy was
        simple enough, though it was not wanting in boldness; but then came
        the difficult question, <span class="tei tei-q">“What road will the
        enemy take—the ordinary route by Emmaüs,<a id="noteref_10" name=
        "noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> or the
        more difficult way through the pass of Beth-horon?”</span> The scouts
        were at fault, but it seemed likely that a general strange to the
        country would prefer the easier course. But scarcely had Judas acted
        on this probability and taken up his position on the plateau
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199"
        id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of Emmaüs, than a breathless
        messenger came rushing in with the intelligence that Beth-horon was
        to be the point of attack. The patriots had already been in motion
        since dawn, but another march was necessary, and, if it was to be of
        any avail, must be executed at full speed, and without any pause for
        food or rest. There had been just time to reach the head of the pass,
        and to hide the vanguard behind rocks and in the ravines that led
        into the main road, when the Greek force was seen to be approaching.
        It was still a mile distant, and as the road was steep, making a rise
        of not less than five hundred feet in the mile, its progress was
        slow. It was an anxious time of waiting as the patriots watched the
        hostile column drawing nearer and nearer. They could see its
        strength, its dense and numerous files, the discipline showed by the
        precision of its march, and its complete equipment, so different from
        their own imperfect supply of weapons and armour. And there were some
        whose hearts fainted within them at the sight. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How shall we, being so few, be able to stand up against
        so great and strong a multitude? And now we are worn with marching,
        and weak for want of bread.”</span> Judas was indefatigable in
        cheering and encouraging them. <span class="tei tei-q">“With the Lord
        our God,”</span> he said, as he went from one company to another,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it is all one to deliver with a great
        multitude, or with a small company.”</span> Then he pointed to
        Ajalon, and recalled to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
        200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        thoughts of his hearers the famous associations of the place.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not remember,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“how Joshua, the son of Nun, smote the five
        kings of the Canaanites? The Lord was with him, staying even the sun
        and the moon in their course, that He might give to His people the
        heritage of the heathen, and surely He will be with us on this day,
        for His name’s sake, that he may restore to us this same heritage.
        His enemies come against us in the pride of their hearts to destroy
        us, and our wives, and our children. But the Lord is on our side; and
        He will overthrow them before our face. And as for you, be not afraid
        of them. Stand fast and quit you like men.”</span> He had not
        completed the round of his force—and indeed there were some companies
        in it which he knew to be of temper so sturdy that they might safely
        be left to themselves—when the Greeks, slowly labouring in their
        heavy armour up the ascent, came within reach. Judas gave the signal,
        and with a loud cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Hammer of God! The
        Hammer of God!”</span> the patriots rose from their ambush, and threw
        themselves on the van of the enemy. The attack was entirely
        unexpected, for the Greek commander was ill-served by his scouts, and
        it met with no serious resistance. Almost in a moment the Greek line
        was broken, and a wild flight commenced. When the fugitives reached
        the plain they scattered themselves in all directions. With his usual
        prudence, Judas checked <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg
        201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his
        men in their pursuit of the vanquished, but eight hundred lay dead or
        seriously wounded upon the plain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seraiah, who had
        extorted from the old physician attached to the patriot army an
        unwilling permission to bear arms, had fallen fainting to the ground,
        close to the entrance to the pass. Near him lay six or seven Greek
        corpses. The tide of battle had passed elsewhere, and the place was
        deserted. This was exactly the opportunity which Benjamin and his
        associates—since his escape during the expedition to Modin he had
        gathered about him a small band—had been watching. They issued from
        their hiding-places among the rocks, and began to search the
        prostrate bodies for spoil. The first that they came to was a Greek
        sub-officer, somewhat richly attired. The man was still alive and
        groaned as they turned him over to get more conveniently at the
        silver ornaments of his belt. <span class="tei tei-q">“Curse the
        villain!”</span> cried Benjamin, as he drove his sword into his side;
        and when the poor wretch breathed his last, went on, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A brave man might have been left to take his chance, but
        such cowards as these ’tis positively a good work to despatch. Did
        you ever see such a scandalous flight?—and they were positively five
        to one at the very least.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was now
        Seraiah’s turn to be stripped. He, too, gave signs of life, and one
        of the robbers, an Edomite, who hated Jews and Greeks impartially,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202"
        id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was about to stab him, when
        Benjamin, who recognized his old comrade’s face, interfered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, man,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“’tis
        one of the patriots, and an old friend of mine to boot. Look you
        after the others, and I will attend to this brave fellow.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hastily and with a
        practised hand he bound up Seraiah’s wound, for the old place had
        broken out afresh. The injured man, consumed by the thirst that
        follows the loss of blood, begged for water. Benjamin supplied him
        with a draught from the bottle which he carried, and followed it up
        with some rough wine of the country in a wooden cup. By this time the
        robbers, who had finished their work of spoiling the dead, were ready
        to return to their hiding-place among the hills.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, captain,”</span> said the Edomite, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“’tis time to go; you had best leave your friend to
        himself, or you will see more of his countrymen than you will quite
        like.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Go,”</span> said Benjamin; <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        will follow you soon.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seraiah was now
        sufficiently revived to be able to sit up. The robber offered him
        bread and flesh. <span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis clean meat,”</span> he
        said. The wounded man, however, refused it. It might be of a lawful
        kind, but he did not know that it had been lawfully killed, and he
        contented himself with bread to which he added a few raisins with
        which he happened to have provided himself. Another draught of wine
        completed the repast.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg
        203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Benjamin,”</span> he said, when he had finished,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you are too good for this life, for these
        friends. Come with us and fight on our side, for be sure that it is
        the side of the Lord. I will intercede for you to our captain, and he
        is as merciful as he is strong.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay,”</span> said Benjamin, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you are too confident; yours may be the side of the
        Lord, for I don’t know much about these things, but the side of the
        Lord, as far as I have been able to see, does not always win. I hate
        these Greeks. They robbed me of my house and everything that I had.
        May all the curses that are written in the Law overtake them! But
        they are very likely to get the best of it after all.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Did you see how they fled to-day?”</span> cried
        Seraiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes; you made them run,”</span> said the robber, with a
        grim laugh. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was rare sport to see them
        pelt helter-skelter down the pass, like so many sheep with a dog
        after them. But there are many more where these came from, and they
        will simply trample you down.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That will not be done so easily as you think. Is Judas
        the Hammer—for that is what the people call him—a likely man to be so
        dealt with? Nay, Benjamin, he is another Joshua, another David, and I
        am as sure as if a prophet had told me that the Lord of Hosts is with
        him, and will deliver the heathen into his
        hands.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
        204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benjamin was
        silent awhile. Then he said, in an altered tone, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You say the truth about Judas, the son of Mattathias. A
        better captain to lead, a better soldier to strike with the sword, I
        never saw. I would gladly follow him. And verily I would sooner fight
        for my people than for my own hand. But your ways are over-strict. I
        cannot put up with these <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class=
        "tei tei-corr">religious</span>’</span> as you call them. Why should
        I not eat pig’s flesh if I can get it? It has a good relish, and it
        has never harmed me yet.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But ’tis forbidden, Benjamin,”</span> gently answered
        Seraiah, now in good hopes of winning over this somewhat stubborn
        proselyte, <span class="tei tei-q">“and you are too good a man to
        give up your country for a matter of meat or drink.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Aye,”</span> said the man, <span class="tei tei-q">“but
        there are other things.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nothing surely that cannot be borne,”</span> went on
        Seraiah. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, Benjamin, you have saved my
        life to-day, and henceforth you are my brother; but I could almost
        wish, but for my wife and child’s sake—you remember Ruth and the
        babe?—that you had left me to die, if I am to see you return to the
        ways of death.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cause was
        almost won when, at an unhappy moment, a party of Jewish soldiers
        returning from the pursuit came in sight. One of them immediately
        recognized Benjamin, and gave the alarm <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to his companions. They rushed to arrest him,
        but Benjamin divined their purpose and dashed up the rocks. To
        overtake him was impossible, for he was fleet of foot and
        unencumbered; but one of the Chasidim, for the soldiers belonged to
        this party, let fly an arrow which struck him in the left arm. It was
        but a slight wound, for the barb was not covered in the flesh; but it
        stirred him to a furious rage, which was all the fiercer because, by
        a great effort, he had just brought himself to yield to Seraiah’s
        arguments. He tore the arrow from the wound, hurled it at his
        pursuers with impotent rage, and crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“All
        the plagues of Egypt consume you!”</span> disappeared among the
        rocks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have lost a good recruit,”</span> said Seraiah to
        his comrades when they returned to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What should this son of Belial profit us?”</span> one of
        the Chasidim haughtily replied. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord
        grant that my next arrow may be driven better home!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seraiah made no
        answer, but painfully lifting himself from the ground made his way up
        the pass alone. He did not care for the company of his comrades, and
        they, on their part, though they could not help respecting him as a
        soldier, thought him sadly wanting in zeal for the Law and for the
        traditions of the elders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Late that night
        some of the fugitives, who had crossed the mountains somewhat further
        to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name=
        "Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>south, reached
        Jerusalem. They found the city anxiously expecting tidings of the
        battle; and two of their number who were officers were at once
        brought into the Governor’s house. He was indisposed, and Cleon, who
        had given up his post at Modin and was now attached to head-quarters,
        saw the new arrivals in his stead. When he had heard their story, he
        did not conceal his scorn for the mismanagement—or was it
        cowardice?—that had made a well-equipped and powerful army flee
        before a crowd of half-armed vagabonds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is easy to talk, my fine sir,”</span> retorted one of
        the men, <span class="tei tei-q">“when you have only got to stop at
        home and find fault; but if you had seen them to-day, you would be
        singing to a very different tune. By all the gods above and below,
        these Jews rushed on more like lions than men. And as to this Judas,
        son of Asmon, there is no standing against him. No man wants two
        blows from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">his</span></span> sword.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“A good soldier, I dare say,”</span> said Cleon
        superciliously, <span class="tei tei-q">“and a skilful swordsman. But
        there are others as good as he. And as for his army, if it is to be
        called an army, it is quite impossible that it can hold out very
        long. I was a little hasty in what I said just now. These fanatics
        have a way of giving some trouble at first, and it is quite possible
        for really good troops to be beaten by them. But it is quite out of
        the question to suppose that they can resist any serious attempt to
        deal with them. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg
        207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Of
        course we have made the usual mistake of making too light of them.
        That must not be done again. The next expedition will be made with
        overwhelming force, and will unquestionably bring this troublesome
        matter to an end. I hope to go with it myself.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That will be as you please, sir,”</span> said the
        officer, who had not by any means recovered his temper after the
        imputations cast on his courage, <span class="tei tei-q">“but if I
        may venture to say so, I would recommend that you should not get in
        the way of Judas, the son of Asmon.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, indeed,
        whatever men like Cleon may have pretended to think, from that time
        <span class="tei tei-q">“began the fear of Judas and his brethren and
        an exceeding great dread to fall upon the nations round about
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effort to wipe
        out the disgrace of the two defeats and to restore the Greek
        supremacy was not long delayed; and when it was made, it was made
        with all the force which the lieutenants of Antiochus could command.
        The King himself was absent in Persia; but his vicegerent had
        <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">carte blanche</span></span> for the preparations
        which they were to make. Lysias, Governor of Syria, had collected
        forty thousand foot and seven thousand horse, and this force had been
        put under the command of Nicanor, Gorgias being his principal
        lieutenant. This time, it was intended, the work should be done
        thoroughly. This Jewish people, so obstinately troublesome, was to be
        absolutely extirpated. Not a single native inhabitant was to be left
        in Palestine, which was to be peopled in future by a more
        accommodating and manageable race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This scheme, if it
        was to be carried out, would <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>involve huge dealings in human flesh, and the
        slave-merchants of the sea-coast cities were, naturally, vastly
        interested in its success. Anxious to do the business as cheaply and
        effectively as possible, they formed what, in the language of modern
        commerce, would be called a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Syndicate,”</span> and sent parties of dealers to follow
        the two armies, and act as their agents when the scheme should begin
        to come into practical working.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was the
        occupation, then, of four repulsive-looking creatures who had
        obtained permission to follow the army of Nicanor, and whom we may
        see discussing a flagon of the best Chian wine—the trade was as
        profitable as it was odious—and canvassing the prospects of
        business.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said one of the four, pursuing the
        narrative of an interview which he had just been having with Lysias,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we had a long debate about terms. The
        Governor was quite firm about one thing: there must be no picking and
        choosing. <span class="tei tei-q">‘No,’</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘either you buy them all, or they shall be put up in the
        open market.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘But what,’</span> I
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘am I to do with the old and the
        weak?’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘And what am I to do with
        them?’</span> he answered. <span class="tei tei-q">‘No; you must buy
        them all or none.’</span> There I could not move him. He could not be
        bothered with detail. For so many prisoners, so many talents, half
        paid down, half six months credit. Old men and women at their last
        gasp, and new-born babes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
        210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were
        all to be counted in. Those were his terms and I had to accept them,
        or we should not have come to an agreement.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That does not seem a good bargain,”</span> interrupted
        another member of the company.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wait a moment,”</span> said the first speaker,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“till you hear the price. I think you will
        agree that there is no reason to complain. At first he wanted a
        talent<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=

        every fifty. That of course was out of the question on the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘take-all’</span> terms, and I told our
        friend so quite plainly. <span class="tei tei-q">‘No,’</span> I said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘a talent for every hundred is about the
        right price, and even then we may very well lose,’</span> which, you
        will allow, was sailing very near the wind indeed. Well, we had a
        long argument. First he would meet me half way. But I held out. You
        know they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        Antiochus—the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Glorious’</span> they call
        him—gone off to Persia on a wild goose chase after some treasures he
        has heard of. I’ll wager that he’ll spend more than he gets by a long
        way. I have friends at Court, and they tell me that the treasury is
        as empty as—well, we’ll say a wine jar, after our friend Nicias there
        has had it at his mouth for a minute. So I was firm. And at last—to
        make a long story short—we came to terms at a talent for ninety. And
        I can’t help thinking that it is not by any means a bad
        bargain.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        the troops, stores, and so forth; and that is to be paid in gold. But
        the greater part has to go to Rome—the King, you know, owes a great
        deal on the indemnity account. For that we shall find bills of
        exchange.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Most of the money, then, is to go to Rome?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes; and don’t you see the advantage of the arrangement?
        Of course most of it will come back into our pockets. Slaves from
        this part of the world are quite the fashion in Rome now; and I am
        very much mistaken if these Jewish slaves don’t turn out a great
        success. They are quite a novelty; I should think that they have
        hardly been seen in the Roman <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        look, and the girls are sometimes remarkably handsome. I don’t like
        to brag—and of course this is all between ourselves—but I think that
        we shall make a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        this campaign.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If our side wins, that is,”</span> said the youngest of
        the dealers, who was evidently a little discomposed by what he had
        heard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">‘if’</span> in the matter. You don’t suppose
        this set of ragged beggars can stand against the army of
        Lysias?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, they stood against Apollonius, and killed him; and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, but this is another matter altogether. Lysias has
        got fifty thousand as good troops as there are in the world, barring,
        of course, the Romans; and they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">must</span></span> win. And then we shall all
        make our fortunes as sure as the sun is in the sky.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, indeed, as
        viewed from without, the prospects of success which seemed to lie
        before the forces of Antiochus were very great. The army was
        powerful—it numbered nearly eight times as many as that of the
        patriots—it was thoroughly well equipped, and it was led by men who
        at least had the reputation of being good soldiers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This time it was
        judged expedient to avoid the difficult pass of Beth-horon and to
        advance by the easier road of Emmaüs. At Emmaüs, accordingly,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213"
        id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Nicanor had pitched his camp
        for the night, intending to move early the next day on Jerusalem, to
        occupy that city with overwhelming force, and to carry on the
        operations of the campaign from that base. He was the more hopeful of
        success because he had received exact information of the position of
        the patriot general. Benjamin had never forgiven the painful wound
        which he had received from the arrow of one of the Chasidim after the
        battle of Beth-horon. The injury had galled him all the more because
        his feelings had been really touched by the appeals of Seraiah, and
        he had seriously meditated throwing in his fortunes once more with
        the cause of his countrymen. He now made his way to the camp of
        Nicanor, and told him all that he knew of the position of Judas. The
        Greek general despatched his lieutenant with a picked force to attack
        him. While the enemy was thus occupied he should be able, he thought,
        to make the passage of the mountains without hindrance or loss.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas was at
        Mizpeh, in command of a force more numerous than any he had before
        been able to collect, but still not amounting to more than six
        thousand men. But the sight that this six thousand saw from the
        Mizpeh ridge—the watch-tower, as it was called—was such as to rouse
        to fury the hearts of all who beheld it. For there, lying before
        them, was the city of their love, the city of David, of Solomon, of
        Josiah, of Hezekiah, of Ezra, and Nehe<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>miah, and they could see, only too plainly in
        the clear sunset light, the horror of its desolation. The streets
        were empty; the walls, in old time thronged at evening by crowds of
        citizens and their families, were deserted; the gates were shut. The
        Temple could be seen, but its courts were silent and empty. And,
        rising above, in the City of David, in the very heart of the Jewish
        kingdom, was the fort of the Greek garrison—the hateful sign of the
        domination of the heathen. Then followed a touching ceremony, by
        which the servants of the Lord, banished from the courts of His
        House, yet sought to show the reverence and the love which they felt
        for its sacred precincts, for the Holy Place which they could see
        with their eyes, though they might not tread it with their feet. A
        numerous company of mourners, chosen to represent the whole people,
        ranged themselves on the ridge which commanded the prospect so sad
        and yet so dear. They were clad in garments of black sackcloth,
        itself ragged and tattered, and had strewn ashes on their heads. They
        spread out copies of the Law—that Law which the heathen had silenced
        in its own peculiar seat, and which they had insulted and profaned,
        picturing on its very pages the cruel and lustful demons whom they
        worshipped; the functions of the priests had ceased, but they could
        at least display within sight of the Sanctuary the garments which
        they wore; the sacrifices could not be offered, but they could at
        least show the bullocks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg
        215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        rams, the firstfruits of the cornfield and the vineyard, and present
        them in heart and will; vows could not be performed, but the
        Nazarites, with their unshorn locks, could stretch out their hands to
        the Sanctuary, and dedicate themselves in intention. And then from
        the whole multitude rose the cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall
        we do with these, and whither shall we carry them? For Thy Sanctuary
        is trodden down and profaned, and Thy priests are in heaviness and
        brought low. And lo! the heathen are assembled together against us to
        destroy us; what things they imagine against us, Thou knowest. How
        shall we be able to stand against them, except Thou, O God, be our
        help?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This done, the
        trumpets sounded, as if to remind the mourners that they were
        soldiers again, and the whole multitude fell at once into military
        order. Judas carefully inspected his force. Mindful of the old
        indulgence given by the Law, he proclaimed that any among his
        followers who were building a house, or planting a vineyard, or had
        left behind him at home a newly-married wife, should depart. Those
        were not days when houses were being built or vineyards planted, for
        the land, save for some barren mountain ranges, was in the power of
        the heathen; nor was it a time for marrying or giving in marriage.
        Scarcely a man out of the whole array claimed the exemption. And when
        the leader went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man be timid or
        of a faint heart, let him turn <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>back, while there is time,”</span> only two or
        three slunk away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To those that
        remained Judas addressed a few stirring words. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have seen,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the city of your fathers from afar, how it lies desolate
        and dishonoured. Be bold and quit you like men, and the Lord will
        deliver it into your hands, for He can deliver both by many and by
        few. Arm yourselves at dawn, and we will fight with those nations who
        have defiled our sanctuary and have now come out to destroy
        us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the struggle
        was to come sooner than any one had looked for it. Azariah had been
        setting the sentinels who were to watch the northern side of the
        encampment, when he heard a voice that seemed to have a familiar
        sound.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Azariah!”</span> it said, in a penetrating whisper.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am here; say on;”</span> and he felt sure that he
        recognized the voice of Benjamin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tell your captain that Gorgias has come out of the camp
        of Nicanor with six thousand men, the very choicest of his army, and
        that he will attack him this night. Farewell!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And before Azariah
        could answer he was out of sight and hearing. A quick remorse had
        overtaken the robber for his treacherous act, and he had done his
        best to remedy the wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas, on hearing
        the news, lost no time in making his resolve. It was bold, even
        audacious. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg
        217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He
        would not wait to be attacked, but would himself attack, and that not
        the detachment under Gorgias, which it was quite possible he might
        have some difficulty in meeting, but the main body itself. Here he
        would certainly have the advantage of being utterly unexpected. And a
        victory over this would be almost, if not absolutely, decisive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly he
        left his camp at Mizpeh without attempting to remove any of his
        belongings. In truth, they were scanty enough, and, if things went
        well with him, he should secure spoil of a hundredfold more value
        than all that he had left. With nothing but their arms, and such
        scanty provision as they could carry in their pouches, his men
        marched through the darkness down into the plain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was
        dawning when he came within sight of the camp of Nicanor. Though not
        regularly fortified, it was a place of considerable strength, which
        an army far more numerous and better equipped than that which Judas
        had under his command might hesitate to attack. The cavalry had
        bivouacked outside; the infantry were within the lines, but might be
        seen passing out of the gates.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So formidable a
        task did it seem to attack a fortified camp, held by a vastly
        superior force, that even Judas’s band of heroes hesitated for a
        moment. He felt it at once, and at once addressed himself to check
        it. He called a halt, and bidding the ranks close in to as small a
        space as possible, he addressed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>them, sending his mighty voice in the still air
        of the morning with so commanding a power that it reached the very
        extremity of the crowd. In a few stirring words he reminded them of
        the deliverances which God had wrought in old time for His people. He
        spoke of the three hundred of Gideon, how they had discomfited the
        host of the Midianites, of the angel that had smitten with an unseen
        sword the legions of the haughty Sennacherib. He told them of the day
        when Macedonian and Jew had stood side by side against the Gallic
        invaders of Asia, and of how the Jew had stood firm while the Greek
        had fled before the fury of the barbarian onset. Finally he reminded
        them of the victories which they themselves had so lately won against
        overwhelming odds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had
        finished his harangue, he divided the host between himself and his
        brothers, John, Simon and Jonathan. Eleazar was to recite the Holy
        Book, and to give his name as the watchword of the day. These
        arrangements made, he gave a signal to the trumpeters. They blew a
        piercing blast. Then, with a shout, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Help
        of God! The Help of God!”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12"
        href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> the
        patriots charged. It might have seemed to an onlooker the strategy of
        despair, but it was successful, as it had been many a time in history
        before, as it has been many a time since.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greeks stared
        at them, as they advanced, with astonishment. Were these men madmen,
        or were they fired by some Divine fury? In either case they would be
        dangerous antagonists. As the patriots drew nearer, without a sign of
        hesitation or holding back, the terror which had been creeping over
        the minds of the Greeks became insupportable. They broke and fled,
        and did not even, so complete was their demoralization, attempt to
        hold their camp. Though pursuit was shortened by the approach of the
        Sabbath, which Judas would not suffer to be infringed upon even to
        complete his victory, more than three thousand fell, and as the Greek
        line had not waited to receive the onset of the patriots, all of them
        perished in the flight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work was not
        yet done, for the detachment under Gorgias had still to be accounted
        for. This, however, gave the conquerors very little trouble. That
        general had found the camp of Judas empty, and had naturally
        concluded that its occupants had been frightened away by his
        approach. He started in pursuit, but without being able to find any
        clear traces of the route which the supposed fugitives had taken.
        Probably, he thought, this would be in the direction of the mountain
        retreat from which they had issued. It was long before he satisfied
        himself that he was mistaken; but the peasants whom he questioned
        were evidently truthful when they declared that they had seen nothing
        of the force <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
        220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        which he was in search. He had to retrace his steps, and could not do
        this till he had given his men a rest, wearied as they were with
        almost incessant marching for a night and a day. It was late in the
        afternoon before he arrived in sight of the camp of the main body,
        and by that time Judas’s victory had been won. He was astonished and
        alarmed to see that part of it was on fire. Shortly afterwards a
        fugitive from the defeated army came in with news of what had
        happened. Neither Gorgias nor his men were in any humour to encounter
        the patriots; they hastily turned and made the best of their way to
        Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Information of
        this retreat was soon brought to Judas by his scouts, and he felt
        that now at last he and his followers might enjoy their victory. The
        Sabbath was given, as usual, to rest and devotion. A great service
        was held, a prominent feature of it being the chanting of the great
        Psalm of Thanksgiving,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
        "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“O give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy
        endureth for ever.”</span> The marvels of creation, the deliverance
        from Egypt, the passage of the hosts of the Lord through the Red Sea,
        the fall of the Amorite kings who had sought to stop their way to the
        Promised Land, the possession of the inheritance which had been
        promised to the fathers—all these blessings were enumerated, and
        after each new theme, given by the clear voices of the singers, rose
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221"
        id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the thunderous chorus of reply
        from the multitude, <span class="tei tei-q">“For His mercy endureth
        for ever.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the first day
        of the week the spoils were divided. The division was made with
        scrupulous fairness, and with a reverent regard to the injunctions of
        the Law. The wounded received a special consideration for their
        sufferings; a share was reserved for the widows and orphans of the
        slain; and those to whom had been given the unwelcome duty of staying
        behind to guard the encampment were not forgotten. The rich furniture
        of the officers’ tents, the gold and silver plate, the many-coloured
        silks, and robes of Tyrian purple, with a well-furnished pay-chest,
        made together a splendid booty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
        prisoners was the party of slave-dealers to whom our readers were

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man turned
        pale and said nothing.</p>

        Furthermore it is agreed that the said Theron and Company shall have
        no claim for a drawback for any such persons dying after they have

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theron stammered
        an assent. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is but a common matter of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several months
        have passed since the scenes described in the last chapter. During
        the winter Judas has been increasing and consolidating his army, and
        he has now a force both more numerous and better equipped than any
        that he had hitherto commanded. Again he has marched to encounter the
        Greeks, but he has no easy task before him. Lysias in person commands
        the Syrian army. Antiochus has sent him some veteran troops from the
        capital; he has raised fresh levies of his own, and he has enrolled
        in his ranks the remnants of the armies of Seron and Nicanor.
        Altogether he has collected an army of sixty thousand men, and must
        out-number his antagonists at least five times. The struggle will be
        of a critical kind, and the victory, if won at all, can hardly be won
        without grievous loss. The Greeks are fighting for their last stake.
        If they lose this they are disgraced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The experience of
        a soldier’s wife had not lessened <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the anxiety with which Ruth waited for news of
        the battle. This time all that were especially near and dear to her
        had gone with the army—her husband, her brother, and Azariah—all had
        run or were even then running deadly peril of their lives. When the
        news came it might find her utterly desolate, a widow indeed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the night
        these terrors had had almost undisputed sway. It seemed impossible to
        her to recall the holy words which at other times brought comfort to
        her soul. Some dreadful picture of her dear ones lying cold and stark
        upon the battle-field would rise up before her eyes; and again and
        again the hideous laughing of the hyenas, echoed among the hills,
        seemed to her like the mocking triumph of the heathen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The light of
        morning brought, as it is wont to bring, if not cheerfulness, at
        least a more hopeful spirit. Anyhow she had not to lie in forced
        inaction. The daily duties had to be done; and she could find in them
        not forgetfulness, indeed, but the wholesome invigorating influence
        of work. Her first task was to fetch the daily ration of food. Miriam
        and Judith accompanied her, and her little boy was now old enough to
        toddle by her side. The girls had already begun to bear the burdens
        of a woman’s cares, but the child was in happy unconsciousness of
        trouble, and there was a certain infection of cheerfulness in his
        laughter and prattle.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
        227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth’s way to the
        store where the rations were distributed led past the point from
        which the best view of the pass could be obtained. She scanned the
        prospect eagerly as she went, but could see nothing. On her return
        she espied the figure of a man who seemed—for he was still almost too
        distant to be distinguished—to be approaching.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Look, girl,”</span> she cried, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“surely some one comes yonder, and he must be bringing
        tidings of the battle. Oh! if they are safe——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she spoke she
        dropped the piece of flesh, which she was carrying, from her hand;
        and immediately a vulture swooped down and carried it off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The watchman had
        now descried the figure of the traveller, and made the signal which
        was to indicate to the inmates of the encampment the fact that
        tidings from the army was at hand. In an instant all that were able
        to move had poured out, and were hurrying to the top of the pass.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The messenger was
        Micah, whom, as one of the fleetest runners in the army, Judas had
        selected to carry the news of his victory. He had traversed the
        distance, which could not have been less than thirty miles, at a pace
        which had sorely tried even his athletic frame. He flung himself on
        the ground, panting convulsively for breath, and unable to speak. One
        of the elders poured a few drops of cordial into his mouth, and by
        degrees he recovered his powers. His first act was to kneel and with
        outspread hands <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg
        228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        thank the Lord of Hosts. <span class="tei tei-q">“We thank thee, God
        of our fathers, that thou hast delivered us out of the hand of the
        enemy, and brought us unto the haven where we would be.”</span> Then,
        amidst the breathless attention of the listening crowd, he told the
        story.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Judas the Hammer,”</span> and as he said the name a
        murmur of blessing could be heard from the whole
        assembly—<span class="tei tei-q">“Judas, the Hammer of God, has
        smitten the enemy to pieces. Two days since he met Lysias—for the
        Governor himself was in command—at Beth-zur. There by that valley of
        Elah, where David slew Goliah of Gath, has the Lord God of Israel
        proved again that the battle is not to the strong nor the race to the
        swift. Judas himself led the right wing; the left he had given to
        Seraiah and Azariah, whom I myself had the privilege of following.
        The lines of the two armies were about equal in length; nor, indeed,
        was there room on either side for more; but they had their ranks
        forty deep and more, and we but seven or eight at the most, for they
        were many times more numerous. But the Lord showed once again that He
        can deliver as surely by few as many. Our captain, than whom no man
        has a more generous temper, though he would gladly have been the
        first to advance against the enemy, granted that privilege to us.
        Then we shouted, as we did in the day of Emmaüs, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-corr">The Lord is our
        Help!</span>’</span> and ran forward. While we were yet half a
        furlong from them, we saw them tremble <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and waver; and before we could cross our swords
        with them their line had broken. That done, their numbers availed
        them no more, but rather hindered them, so crowded and crushed
        together were they. We slew till we were weary of
        slaying.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what befell Lysias, the Governor?”</span> asked one
        of the elders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He had posted himself over against Judas himself,
        judging that there would be the most need of his presence. And indeed
        they say—for I myself did not see him, being, as I have said, on the
        other side of the field—that he bore himself as a brave soldier and a
        good captain. And Judas, when he saw him, pressed forward, seeking to
        meet him face to face. But Lysias was struck with terror and fled. He
        had not the heart to abide a stroke from the Hammer. He escaped with
        some hundred horsemen of his bodyguard from the field. The prisoners
        say that he is gone to Antioch to gather another army. Let him gather
        it. We will deal with it and him as we have dealt hitherto with the
        enemies of the Lord.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what does Judas now?”</span> asked the elder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a look of joy
        and triumph Micah lifted his head and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is in Jerusalem. The Lord has given back into our
        hands the Holy City, the City of David His servant.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is impossible
        to describe the delight with which this announcement was received.
        The women, even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg
        230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        men, wept for joy. This was indeed a glorious gain of victory. Last
        year they could only see the Holy City from afar, and weep over its
        desolation. Now they could pour out their love and their sorrow
        within its sacred precincts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> he repeated, <span class="tei tei-q">“Judas
        is in Jerusalem, and is making ready to purify the Temple. And you
        are to return as speedily as you can. The days of your exile are
        over. Our God has recalled His banished unto Him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His public mission
        finished, Micah could give time to private affection. He went with
        Ruth and <a name="corr230" id="corr230" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">the</span> children
        to their cave, and then, after sharing their morning meal, told them
        all they wanted to hear. Seraiah and Azariah were both safe, though
        both had had narrow escapes, Azariah’s helmet having been broken in
        by a sword-stroke from a gigantic Gaul, and Seraiah being saved by a
        little roll of the Prophecy of Daniel, which he always carried about
        with him—it was a gift from his wife—and which had stopped the point
        of a javelin that would otherwise have pierced his heart. Ruth and
        the children were never satisfied with asking questions and listening
        to his answers. Even the little Daniel seemed to understand something
        of what was being said, as he listened, with his baby-eyes wide open,
        to the talk of his elders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And Cleon,”</span> asked Ruth, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Greek with whom you used to be so friendly in time

        231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>you
        see him? You met him, you told us, in Modin, and parted in anger; did
        you meet him again?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cloud seemed to
        pass over Micah’s face at this question, and for a few moments he was
        silent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah! Ruth,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Lord be merciful to him, as He has been merciful to me! And did I not
        sin against Him tenfold more grievously than any heathen could have
        sinned? For was I not a child of the Covenant, and had I not light
        and knowledge, whereas he was born in ignorance and knew not of the
        mercies and deliverances which I knew, and knowing
        despised.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Is he a prisoner, then?”</span> asked Miriam,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and will Judas spare him?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He needs no mercy from man, my child,”</span> said
        Micah, solemnly. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the battle I did not
        meet him. That was well. I should have been loath to cross swords
        with him; and yet I could hardly have failed to do so. But in the
        evening, when Lysias had fled eastward with the remnants of his host,
        and the victory was won, I saw him on the field of battle. The
        captain himself was with me, as we went among the wounded and the
        dead, looking for any to whom we could give such help as they needed.
        He had been pierced with a ghastly wound through the breast. And when
        Judas saw him, he said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ah! that is a
        brave soldier, and as good a swordsman as ever I met. I had a hard
        bout with him this morning, and had he not slipped in making
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232"
        id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a blow, it might have gone ill
        with me. Do you know him?’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Yes;’</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘in the old
        time, when I mingled with the heathen and walked in their
        ways.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘See, then, whether you can
        help him in any way; I love a brave man, be he heathen or no.’</span>
        I was willing enough to do anything that I could for him, you may be
        sure; one glance at that pale face was enough to chase away all the
        anger with which we had parted. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Cleon!’</span> I said. And he knew me and smiled—a very
        wan and feeble smile, but still a smile. Then I tried to stanch the
        blood that was flowing from his wound. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Nay,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘’tis
        idle; I am past all help; let it flow, and I shall be sooner out of
        my pain. But, dear Menander—nay, pardon me, I should call you
        Micah—give me some water to drink, for I have a raging
        thirst.’</span> I had a leathern bottle of water, and gave him a
        draught. Then I rested his head upon my shoulder, and bathed his
        forehead with the water. Judas meanwhile had gone further, and I saw
        a party of the Chasidim ranging the field, and I thought that they
        could scarcely pass us by without seeing us, so I said to Cleon,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let me lay you down till these are past; for
        if they know you as a friend of Jason they will not spare your life.
        ’Tis better to feign death than to meet it at their hands.’</span>
        Then he smiled and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘No need, Micah, to
        feign death. Your Hammer has smitten me down, and I shall not need
        another stroke.’</span> And almost as he spoke the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>words, he died. And just then the captain
        came back, and we buried him where he had fallen. The Lord have mercy
        on him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day Micah
        returned, in obedience to orders, and two or three days afterwards
        all the party that had been left in the mountains followed him to
        Jerusalem. It was a happy day, but saddened, for the children at
        least, by one loss. The jackal, Jael, followed the party awhile, but
        when they reached the plain, stood still and watched them disappear,
        making mournful cries the while. Even the prospect of seeing their
        old home could not quite reconcile the children to the loss of this
        strange playmate, who had yet grown so dear to them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so the rugged
        mountains which had afforded a refuge to the faithful remnant were
        left again to silence and solitude. But the memory of what the
        confessors and martyrs had endured in the evil days was never to
        perish. Generation after generation remembered with sympathy and
        reverence what men, aye, and weak women and children had borne for
        conscience’ sake—cold and hunger and nakedness, and that anguish of
        soul which is harder to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg

        endured than all bodily pain. Two centuries later, an inspired
        Hebrew, writing to Hebrews, commemorated the noble endurance of this
        faithful band in his famous roll of the triumphs of faith:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They wandered about in sheepskins and
        goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world
        was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in dens

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among those who
        watched the approach of Judas and his host to Jerusalem were two men,
        one in extreme old age, the other numbering, it would seem, about
        fifty years. They wore the priestly garments, old indeed and
        threadbare, but still clean and showing many signs of careful repair.
        Theirs was a strange history. For two years they had been in hiding
        in the city. When Apollonius had filled the streets of Jerusalem with
        blood, the murderers had sought with especial care for all priests
        and Levites. To them at least no mercy was to be shown. These two
        men—Shemaiah was the name of the elder of the two, and Joel that of
        the younger—had narrowly escaped death from the soldiers of
        Apollonius. They had taken refuge—so close was the pursuit—in a
        garden, the gate of which happened to be open, and had hidden
        themselves in the bushes till nightfall. Where they were, who or of
        what <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name=
        "Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>race was the owner of
        the house, whether they were likely to meet with more mercy from his
        hands than they could expect from the soldiers, they knew not. But
        that hiding-place was their only chance, and in their desperate
        strait they snatched at it. While they were debating in whispers
        whether they should throw themselves on the compassion of this
        unknown person, they saw—for it was a moonlight night—the figure of a
        woman walking down a path which passed close by their hiding-place.
        They could see from her features, which the brilliant moonlight of
        the East lighted up, that she was a countrywoman of their own, and
        they resolved to appeal to her for protection. Shemaiah, whose age
        and venerable appearance would, they judged, be less likely to alarm,
        threw himself on the ground at her feet. She started back in
        astonishment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lady,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I see
        that you are a daughter of Abraham. Can you help two servants of the
        Lord that have so far escaped from the sword of the
        Greeks?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was reassured
        by a nearer view of the speaker. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are
        you?”</span> she said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Speak without fear,
        for there is no one to harm you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shemaiah told his
        story.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And your companion,”</span> said Eglah—for that was the
        woman’s name—<span class="tei tei-q">“where is he?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man called
        to Joel, who came forth at his bidding from his
        hiding-place.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg
        237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eglah stood for a
        few minutes buried in thought. Then she spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As I hope that the Lord will have mercy on me and pardon
        my sin, so will I help you even to the giving up of my life. But I am
        not worthy that you should come under my roof. Now listen to my
        story. When Antiochus—the Lord reward him for the evil that he has
        done to His people!—came to this city, I was seized and sold for a
        slave. And a certain Greek soldier, Glaucus by name, the captain of a
        company, bought me in the market. He had compassion on me, and dealt
        honourably with me, and made me his wife after the fashion of his
        people. And I consented to live with him, though I knew that it was a
        sin for a daughter of Abraham to be wife unto a man that was a
        heathen. But alas! sirs, what was I to do? for I was a weak woman,
        and there was no one to help me. Should I have slain him in his
        sleep, as Judith slew Holofernes? Once I thought to do so, and I took
        a dagger in my hand, but when I saw him I repented. Whether it was
        fear or love that turned me I know not. That I was afraid I know, for
        the very sight of the steel made me tremble. And I must confess that
        I loved him also, for he had been very kind and gentle with me; and
        there is not a goodlier man to look at in all Jerusalem.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Be comforted, my daughter,”</span> said Shemaiah, whose
        years had taught him a tolerance to which <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>his younger companion had, perhaps, scarcely
        attained. <span class="tei tei-q">“’Tis at least no sin for a wife to
        love her husband.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you do not think me so wicked as to be beyond all
        hope?”</span> cried poor Eglah, eagerly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, my daughter,”</span> said the old man; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you were in a sore strait, and all women are not as
        Judith was.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then you will not refuse to come into my house? I have a
        large cellar where you can lie hid. ’Tis under the ground, indeed,
        but airy and dry, and you can make shift to live there. And I will
        feed you as best I may. My husband has an open hand, and never makes
        any question as to the money that I spend upon the house, and he will
        not know what I have done. I judge it best to keep the thing from
        him, not because I fear that he would betray you—for he is an
        honourable man and kindly, but it would go hard with him, being an
        officer in the army of the King, if it should be discovered that he
        knew it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so for two
        years Shemaiah and Joel had inhabited the cellar in Eglah’s house.
        Glaucus, the husband, was just the kindly, generous man whom his wife
        had described. Once or twice he had terrified her by some joking
        remark about the rapidity with which the provision purchased for the
        house disappeared. <span class="tei tei-q">“When we dine together, my
        darling,”</span> he said, on one occasion, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you eat what would be scarce enough for a well-favoured
        fly; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name=
        "Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but I am glad to think
        that you are hungry at other times.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O husband,”</span> she said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“there are many poor of my own people, and I cannot deny
        them.”</span> She hoped as she said it that the falsehood would not
        be counted as another sin against her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,
        nay, darling,”</span> said the good-natured man. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Give as much as thou wilt. Thank the gods and his
        Highness the King I have enough and to spare.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glaucus, though
        allowed to live in his own house, had, of course, to spend much time
        upon his military duties, and was, consequently, often away. During
        his absence Eglah could bring out the two prisoners from their
        underground lodging, and allow them to enjoy the fresh air of the
        garden, which, happily, was not overlooked. She gave them the best
        food that her means would procure, and at the same time took pains,
        as has been said, to keep their garments scrupulously clean and neat.
        On the whole they passed the time of their captivity in tolerable
        comfort, and without much injury to their health. Latterly they had
        been cheered by the tidings, always given to them at the very
        earliest opportunity by their hostess, of the successes of Judas.
        Within the last few days Glaucus had told his wife that a decisive
        battle was expected, that it would probably be fought at Beth-zur,
        and that if her countrymen won it, there was nothing that could
        hinder them from taking possession of Jerusalem.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glaucus, who held
        a command in the garrison of the fort, had not been with Lysias at
        Beth-zur, but he had heard late on the evening of the day of the
        result of the battle and had, of course, told it to his wife, and she
        in turn had communicated it to her inmates. They had been scarcely
        able to sleep for joy, and had eagerly waited for news of the
        conqueror’s approach. Evening was come, and Eglah had not paid them
        the accustomed visit. The house was curiously silent; all day not a
        sound of voices or steps had reached their ears. And now the suspense
        had become unbearable. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go forth,”</span>
        said Shemaiah to his younger companion, <span class="tei tei-q">“go
        forth, and bring me word again.”</span> Joel crept out of his
        retreat. The streets were deserted; but the fortress was crowded. The
        garrison stood thickly clustered on the walls, and with them were
        many inhabitants of the city. It was easy to guess that what Glaucus
        had foretold had happened. Judas was on his way to take possession of
        Jerusalem, and all who had compromised themselves by resisting him,
        had either fled from the place altogether or had taken refuge in the
        fort. He returned to Shemaiah with a description of what he had seen,
        and the two at once hastened down to the walls to greet the
        deliverers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was near
        its setting when they entered the city. Without turning to the right
        or left, though many must have been consumed with <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>anxiety to hear the fate of kinsmen and
        friends, they marched to Mount Sion. It was an hour of triumph, the
        fruition of hopes passionately cherished through many a dark day of
        sorrow. To stand once more in the place which God had chosen to set
        His name there, how glorious. But it had its bitterness, as such
        hours will have, for it was a miserable sight that greeted them.
        Nothing, indeed, had been done of which they had not heard. There was
        nothing that they might not have expected or foreseen. Yet the actual
        view of the holy place in its dismal forlornness overpowered them. It
        was as if the sight had come upon them by surprise. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When they saw the Sanctuary desolate and the altar
        profaned, and the gates burnt with fire, and shrubs growing in the
        courts as in a forest or one of the mountains, and the chambers of
        the priests pulled down, they rent their clothes, and made great
        lamentations, and cast ashes upon their heads, and fell down flat to
        the ground upon their faces.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To repair this
        ruin, to put an end to this desolation, to purify the place which had
        been so shamefully polluted, was the first duty of the deliverers.
        But that the work might be done in peace it was necessary that the
        fortress of Acra, to use military language, should be masked. A
        strong force was told off to perform this duty; the rest would lend
        their aid to the great work of purification.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah and Micah
        had been put under John, the eldest of the five brothers, in command
        of the force employed to blockade the garrison of Acra. The night had
        passed quietly; the garrison had not attempted a sortie, and had not
        even harassed the besiegers with a discharge of missiles. And when
        the morning came they seemed inclined to continue the same inaction.
        From the high ground the two Jews looked down upon the Temple courts
        and saw the priests directing a crowd of eager helpers in the work of
        cleansing the Sanctuary, and labouring diligently with their own
        hands. The first task was to pull down the idol altar which had been
        erected on the altar of burnt-offering. This was done in a fury of
        haste. The hands of the workmen could not, it seemed, move fast
        enough in destroying the abominable thing. The stones were carried
        out of the temple with gestures of loathing and disgust, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and afterwards taken to the Valley of
        Hinnom—unholy things to be cast away in an unholy place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the stones of
        the holy altar itself had been polluted by the superstructure that
        had been erected upon them. What was to be done with them? At least
        it was manifest that they could not stand where they were. Sacrifice
        could not be offered upon them. They were reverently detached from
        the cement which bound them together, and then borne one by one to a
        chamber of the Temple, where they were to be laid up till a prophet
        should arise who should show what was to be done with them. The first
        duty of dealing with the altar completed, came the work of cleansing
        and repairing the courts and chambers. The long, trailing creepers
        were pulled down; the weeds and shrubs were rooted out. The place was
        still a ruin, but the manifest signs of its desolation and
        abandonment were removed. So numerous and so eager were the labourers
        that for this part of the work a few hours sufficed. The task of
        reparation would, of necessity, be longer and more tedious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah and Micah
        had been watching the work with perhaps a more absorbing interest
        than was quite consistent with their duty of watching the garrison,
        when suddenly one of the sentries blew an alarm. Scarcely had it
        sounded when a flight of arrows from the garrison of the fortress
        fell among the besiegers. The Greeks had watched <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their opportunity, and when almost all
        eyes were turned on the work that was going on below, had sent a
        volley among the ranks of the enemy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sudden attack
        did no little damage. One or two of the patriots were killed on the
        spot, several were seriously wounded; the others either covered
        themselves with their shields, a precaution which they ought not to
        have neglected, or sought refuge among the ruins.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah, though he
        had been caught a little off his guard, was not unprepared to deal
        with a manifestation of this kind. He had organized a company of
        slingers, and he now ordered them to advance and clear the wall of
        its defenders. They knelt with one knee upon the ground, and covered
        themselves with their shields. Under this shelter they loaded their
        slings. Then, rising rapidly at a preconcerted signal from their
        commander, they sent a simultaneous and well-directed shower of
        leaden bullets on the defenders of the wall. These missiles, sent
        with a skill and a strength in which the Jewish slingers were
        unsurpassed, had a marvellous effect. In a moment the wall was
        cleared, except that here and there along its length the dead and
        wounded might be seen. The survivors did not venture forth from
        shelter to carry them away. A fierce conflict followed. From the
        loopholes of the towers and from behind the battlements the Greek
        archers kept up the discharge of their arrows, and the Jewish
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245"
        id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>slingers replied. No great
        damage was done on either side; but every now and then a skilful aim
        at some exposed body or limb was followed by a cry of pain from the
        wounded man, and the cry was taken up by a shout of triumph from the
        hostile force. In the course of the afternoon a storm came on, with
        thunder and lightning and a deluge of rain. Before it had cleared
        away the light had failed, and hostilities had perforce to be
        suspended.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the
        beginning of the second watch<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16"
        href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> Micah,
        who was making a round of the sentries, heard the sound of something
        that seemed to fall heavily upon the soft and plashy ground. The rain
        had ceased, and the sky had partially cleared; for a few minutes all
        was still; then Micah could hear a sighing which was not the sighing
        of the wind. He followed the guidance of the sound, and found a woman
        lying almost insensible upon the ground. He called one of the
        sentinels to help him, and together they carried her under shelter,
        and brought torches, by the light of which they might examine her
        injuries. That she was stunned by the fall was evident, for she did
        not speak, and when they attempted to move her she groaned with the
        pain. When left alone she did not seem to suffer much, and they
        judged it best to wait for the morning, administering meanwhile a
        little wine and water from time to time.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning
        four of the soldiers were told off to remove her on a litter that had
        been constructed for the use of the wounded to a deserted house in
        the Lower City—and of deserted houses there was only too great a
        choice. As the bearers put down their burden on the way to take a
        brief rest a strange figure came up to the party. It was a woman,
        young and still showing the remains of beauty, but with a miserably
        haggard look. It was easy to see from her uncertain gait and
        wandering eye that she was a lunatic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Huldah had been
        for some time a well-known figure in Jerusalem, and her story was of
        the saddest. She had been a servant in the house of Seraiah, and had
        been Ruth’s own waiting-maid. Returning home from some errand on
        which she had been sent one day at the beginning of Apollonius’s
        reign of terror, she had been seized by the attendants of the
        newly-dedicated Temple of Jupiter, and made a slave. Before many
        weeks had passed the cruel outrages to which she was subjected
        overthrew her reason. Thus become a trouble to her captors she was
        permitted to escape. Since then she had been accustomed to wander
        about the city. The horrors of the past still haunted her, and the
        recollection of the abominable idolatries in which she had been
        forced to serve. At every pool of water and fountain she would stay
        and wash. From every passer-by she would beg for something that might
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247"
        id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>serve for her cleansing: it was
        the one craving of her soul to be rid of its defilement. For food or
        money she never asked; but a few kindly souls in the city gave her
        enough to support life, and sometimes would renew the garments,
        threadbare, but always scrupulously neat and clean, which she wore.
        Of these friends the kindest was Eglah, who had a fellow-feeling for
        the sufferer, and who was always on the watch to atone by her
        charitable deeds for what she believed to be the great offence of her
        life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Huldah cast a
        glance at the litter in passing, and at once recognized in the
        suffering woman her own benefactress. For indeed it was Eglah whom
        Micah had found under the fortress wall. The recognition made a
        marvellous change in the poor maniac. It turned her thoughts in
        another direction. She ceased to dwell upon her own sufferings, and,
        for the time at least, reason regained its sway.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She knelt down by
        the side of the litter, and kissed one of the hands that hung
        listlessly down. Then, rising to her feet, she arranged the cushion
        on which Eglah lay so as to make it more comfortable. That done, she
        bade the bearers take up their burden, made a gesture of dissent when
        they were turning aside to the house to which they had been directed,
        and led the way to Eglah’s own dwelling.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unhappy
        creature was positively transformed by the charge which had thus been
        laid upon her. The most intelligent and thoughtful nurse could not
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248"
        id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have done better for her
        patient than did the poor distracted Huldah. A physician who was
        called in examined Eglah, and found that though she had been sadly
        bruised and shaken, no bones were broken. Whether any internal injury
        existed was more than he could positively say; that time alone would
        show. Meanwhile careful attention was all that could be done for her,
        and attention more careful than Huldah’s it would be impossible to
        imagine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two priests
        who had found shelter in Eglah’s house were naturally among those
        whom Judas had summoned to take part in the cleansing of the Temple
        when he made proclamation for all such as, being of the House of
        Aaron, were <span class="tei tei-q">“of blameless conversation and
        had pleasure in the Law.”</span> Posts of special dignity were,
        indeed, conferred upon them, for both were men of high reputation for
        sanctity and learning, which was not a little increased by the
        romantic story of their long seclusion and marvellous escape. Judas
        assigned them quarters near to his own, and was accustomed to have
        frequent recourse to their advice. They thus found themselves almost
        constantly employed, and were unable for several days to find an
        opportunity of inquiring what had happened to their protectress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When at last they
        found their way to the house Eglah had sufficiently recovered her
        strength to be able to rise from her bed. She was sitting, busy with
        her needle. Huldah was watching her with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>an intense look of affection that was infinitely
        pathetic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor woman
        told her story with a voice that again and again was broken with
        sobs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When I was preparing your morning meal in the kitchen my
        husband, whom I had never before known to set foot in the place,
        suddenly appeared. I was greatly terrified lest he should ask for
        whom I was getting the food ready, but he was too much occupied with
        other things to notice it at all. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Eglah,’</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘you
        must come with me into the fort. Judas the Hammer has broken our army
        to pieces. Lysias has fled before him, no one knows whither, and
        within a few hours he will be in the city. I would have you here, for
        the fort is scarcely a place for a woman, but I fear your people.
        Haply they may slay you as having been yoked to a heathen. My
        darling,’</span> he went on—and here poor Eglah’s voice was choked
        with tears—<span class="tei tei-q">‘I have done ill for you, I fear;
        but I meant it for the best. And now, I fear, you must cast in your
        lot with me. May the God whom you serve turn it for good.’</span> So
        I gathered a few things together, and went with him. I thought many
        times that we should scarcely have reached the fort alive, for the
        people cursed us as we went, the women especially casting many bitter
        words at me as one that had left her people to join herself to the
        heathen. But my husband had some six or seven soldiers with him; and
        they were brave men and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
        250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>well
        armed. We had not been many hours in the fort before there began a
        battle between the garrison and the soldiers of Judas. One of my
        husband’s men, who had gone in a spirit of folly and vanity to show
        his courage, was struck down with a stone, and my husband ran forth
        to drag him in. And just as he was returning, another stone from the
        slingers struck him on the back of his head. It was about the ninth
        hour of the day when he was wounded, and he lived till the beginning
        of the second watch, but he never spoke again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the poor
        creature’s story became confused and broken, and her listeners could
        only guess what had followed. The tale of what followed must be told
        for her. <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Ah!’</span> said one of the soldiers, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Glaucus has it. He will never move again, I reckon. A
        good fellow, but overstrict.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘But how
        about the Jewish girl whom he calls his wife?’</span> said the other;
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘I shall take her.’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Nay, nay; let there be fair play between us, comrade, as
        there has always been. Why you more than I?’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Because I was the first to speak.’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Not so; ’twas I that first spoke of her.’</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well, we won’t quarrel, comrade. No woman is
        good enough to separate old friends. Let us cast the dice for her,
        and the man that wins shall stand treat for a flagon of wine.’</span>
        And then Eglah heard them cast the dice, and count the numbers—they
        would have twenty throws a-piece, they said—and curse and swear when
        they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name=
        "Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>threw low. And when
        they had finished their dice-throwing they came in to see how Glaucus
        fared; and just as they entered the chamber, he drew a long breath
        and died. One of them put his hand upon his heart and said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘’Tis all over with him; he will never toss a
        flagon or kiss a pretty girl again.’</span> And then he laid his hand
        upon Eglah’s shoulder, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Cheer up;
        we will find another husband for thee as good as he.’</span> But the
        first said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nay, Timon, leave her alone. The
        women are not like us. You must give them a few hours to cry.’</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well, well,’</span> said his comrade,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘you were always soft-hearted. Let us come
        and have our flagon; there is no reason why we should wait for
        that.’</span> ”</span> The comrades went on their errand and left the
        widow alone with her dead husband. She kissed him, and cut off a
        little curl of his hair, and then went forth on the wall—for the
        chamber in which he lay was in one of the wall-towers—and threw
        herself down to the ground. It was better, she thought, to die than
        to sin again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Daughter,”</span> said Joel, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you should thank the Lord that, without your own doing,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Him, though I do try to say in my heart, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thy

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        Jew or Greek. Before the Lord, I had thought ill of her had she been
        of the temper that you would have her.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eglah turned to
        the old man a grateful look. <span class="tei tei-q">“O sir,”</span>
        she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you do not know how kind and good
        my Glaucus was. I never had an angry word from him. Nor did he ever
        hinder me from my prayers. Rather he would say when I went three
        times to my chamber to pray, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Speak a word
        for me, wife, if you will.’</span> And he would oftentimes speak to
        me about my God, and say that he liked Him better than the gods in
        whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">he</span></span> had been taught to believe. And
        I used to tell him stories out of the Book, and how the Lord had
        delivered his people out of the land of Egypt, and had brought them
        into the land which He sware to Abraham to give him. And he never
        mocked or laughed, but listened with all his heart. And, sir, I do
        sometimes think that if he had been spared to live longer, he would
        have become one of us. But he is dead, and I shall never, never see
        him any more.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the poor
        desolate widow burst out into a passion of tears, and threw herself
        prostrate on the couch, Huldah trying to comfort her, not with
        words—which, indeed, she could not command, and which, in any case,
        would have been of small avail—but with great demonstrations of
        love.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a while
        Eglah looked up, and turning to Shemaiah, in whose sympathy and
        charity she <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg

        do you think that there is any hope for him? Must he go into that
        dreadful Gehenna? For indeed he was kind and good, and never thought
        of any woman but his wife, and never injured one of our people, but
        would help them and defend them when his fellows were rough with
        them. He was better than many Jews that I know. Is it not possible
        that God may have mercy upon him?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joel was about to
        speak, but Shemaiah beckoned to him to hold his peace. <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jerusalem now
        began to assume an aspect very different from that which it had borne
        for some years past. Thousands, who had been driven away by the
        terrors of the evil days, now hastened to return. Many of the lower
        class, constrained by the necessity of poverty, had always remained,
        enduring persecution as best they could, and often, of course,
        escaping it by their obscurity. Now the wealthier inhabitants began
        to flock back from their hiding-places in the country and from
        foreign lands; the streets again began to be busy; the shopkeepers
        displayed the wares which there had been no one to purchase, or which
        they had been afraid to show; the long-shut markets were reopened and
        thronged with purchasers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priests alone,
        gathered as they were from their abodes scattered throughout
        Palestine, made a considerable addition to the population of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255"
        id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>city. They were a numerous
        class, far beyond any requirements of their sacrificial duties, and
        commonly remained at home, awaiting the rarely recurring occasion of
        services that called them to Jerusalem. But now a work was before
        them in which all could take part, for the Temple, having been
        cleansed and having received such repair as could be done at once,
        was to be dedicated afresh.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        necessary work was the construction of a new altar of sacrifice. This
        work was to be of the primitive kind, in strict conformity to the
        Law, and as unlike as possible to the elaborate erections of the
        alien worship, and it was to be done, from first to last, by the
        consecrated hands of the priests. They dug out of the earth of the
        valley rough stones. No tool of iron was to be used in raising them
        from their place; none was to be employed in hewing them into shape.
        It was the priests again who solemnly conveyed them into the Great
        Court of the Temple, who joined them together with mortar, and
        covered them with whitewash. Meanwhile other preparations for a
        wholly renovated service were being busily carried on. Most of the
        furniture of the Temple had been carried off by a succession of
        plunderers; if any of the less valuable and less easily removed
        articles had been left these had suffered an irremediable defilement.
        Everything therefore had to be replaced; and workmen were now busily
        employed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg
        256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        this work. The altar of incense, the candlestick with its seven
        branches, the table on which the loaves of the shew-bread were to be
        placed, the mercy-seat with the overshadowing cherubim that was the
        chief feature of the Holy of Holies, and the various curtains that
        were needed for the separation of the various parts of the building,
        were manufactured with all possible haste, some of the articles, from
        lack of time and materials, being intended to serve their purpose
        only till they could be more worthily replaced. Generally, however,
        it was time rather than means that was wanting, for in the late
        campaigns treasure almost enough to replace the spoliations of years
        had been taken from the Greeks, and this, after being duly purified
        and blessed, could be devoted to holy uses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so came on the
        day that had been appointed for the Feast of Dedication. It was to be
        the 25th of the month Chisleu.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18"
        href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> It was a
        memorable day, both for good and evil, in the annals of Jewish
        worship. On this day, ages before, Jerusalem, the newly-won capital
        of the nation, had been finally chosen as the place where God should
        set His name; for on this day David, as he made atonement in the day
        of pestilence, bought the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite to
        be the future dwelling-place of the Presence of the Lord God of
        Israel. And on this day, again, five years ago, the first
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257"
        id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>idol sacrifice had been offered
        within the consecrated precincts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the early
        morning, before the sun had risen upon the earth, a spark was
        obtained by striking stone against stone, the fire was rekindled on
        the altar, the golden candlestick was lighted and the table of the
        shew-bread duly furnished with its twelve loaves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the rest
        of the people also had been busy in making preparations for the great
        celebration. Every family, even the poorest, was to keep festival on
        the day that was to be a new beginning of the national life. The
        women and children were early afoot, gathering branches of palms and
        other <span class="tei tei-q">“goodly trees”</span>; none of them
        having busier hands than Ruth and her nieces. Even the little Daniel
        would take his part in the work, tottering along by his mother’s side
        with his arms full of boughs. When they had gathered as great a
        burden as they could carry, Ruth gathered her little company about
        her, and told them, just as the rising sun began to flood the valley
        with its slanting rays, the story of the day—of the glory and the
        shame which it had brought to Israel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, as the
        time of the morning sacrifice drew near, the whole people moved in
        one great stream towards the Temple, and the Great Court was crowded.
        On the walls of the fortress the heathen soldiers of the garrison
        stood in throngs watching the solemnities of the day. Some of them,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258"
        id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of course, were ready with
        their mockery; but most looked on in respectful silence. Many of them
        had witnessed the prowess of these strange fanatics in the field.
        They might be given over to a <span class="tei tei-q">“senseless and
        tasteless superstition,”</span> but they could deal shrewd blows with
        their swords, and therefore they were not to be despised. No truce
        had been arranged, but one was tacitly observed. The forbearance of
        the Greeks was partly due to a wholesome awe of the Jewish archers
        and slingers, partly to a curiosity that, as has been said, was not
        wholly unmixed with respect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
        solemn ritual of sacrifice. This ended, the whole congregation of the
        people united in solemn supplication to the Lord God of Israel.
        Usually it was the custom to stand during the office of prayer;
        sometimes the attitude of kneeling was used; now, as if to express
        the intensity of their feeling, they threw themselves flat upon their
        faces, and poured out their entreaty that evils such as they had
        endured in the past might never again come upon them in the future.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“O Lord,”</span>—this was the burden of their
        prayer,—<span class="tei tei-q">“if we sin against Thee any more, do
        Thou chasten us Thyself with Thine own hand, after the multitude of
        Thy mercies. Make us suffer that which shall seem good to Thee here
        in our own land, but scatter us no more among the heathen, and
        deliver us not again unto the nations that blaspheme Thy holy
        name.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
        259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prayer ended,
        came the great Psalm of Thanksgiving; and then the people dispersed
        to their houses to hold festival. Their mirth was prolonged far into
        the night, which, indeed, was almost turned into day throughout the
        streets of Jerusalem, so brilliant was the light that streamed from
        the lamps set in almost every window.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For eight days the
        Feast of Dedication was continued. Each day the services began with
        the customary morning sacrifice. At earliest dawn the Master of the
        Temple summoned the priests who had been watching round the fire in
        the gate-house as they waited for his summons. Then they went out and
        fetched the lamb for the burnt-offering. The creature had already
        been examined on the previous day, and pronounced to be free from
        spot or blemish. This done, they went outside the court in which the
        great altar stood, and watched for the coming day. The Mount of
        Olives stood between them and the East, and far behind it were the
        mountains of Moab. Here the first streaks of the morning light were
        to show themselves. Then the priest whose turn it was to slay the
        victim of the day bathed in the great laver. Thus purified for the
        performance of his office, he stirred up the burning embers from
        under the ashes of the altar, and added fresh fuel. This done, he was
        joined by the other priests, and the morning sacrifice was offered.
        Then followed the special ceremonies of the festival, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>among them the prayer for deliverance from
        captivity, as already given, and the singing of the great
        Thanksgiving. And every day the public services were followed by
        private rejoicings. No one could have believed that the rejoicing
        city, gay with its brightly dressed throngs of merry-makers and
        resounding with the music of tabret and harp, was the desolate place
        so long trodden down by the heathen. There had been days in the past
        when the most hopeful could scarcely discern any light in the
        darkness. But now they could see the <span class="tei tei-q">“silver
        lining of the cloud.”</span> In this very Temple, now dedicated
        afresh with such joyous zeal, but a few years before, the priests
        <span class="tei tei-q">“had left the sacrifices when the game of the
        Discus called them forth.”</span> That deadly folly had been purged
        with blood. The brutal violence of Antiochus had saved the nation
        from an imminent relapse into heathenism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the many
        hearts that were gladdened by these rejoicings there was one, as
        sorely burdened as any, that had found a complete deliverance from
        the troubles of the past. The unhappy Huldah, in proportion as her
        charge gained strength, and her work became less absorbing, had
        seemed to be falling back into her old condition. For the time her
        thoughts had been concentrated on the suffering Eglah; now they were
        free to be turned upon herself, her own troubles, her own dismal
        memories. Eglah did all she could to keep her employed, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261"
        id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the girl’s gentle and
        affectionate nature still felt her influence. Yet it was evident that
        unless some remedy could be found the old madness would resume its
        sway.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the first day
        of the Dedication festival, the two were standing together in the
        Court of the Women. The priests, who were making a circuit of the
        whole building, sprinkling everywhere the blood of purification, came
        in due course to the spot. As they performed their office a drop fell
        upon the garment of Huldah, who had been joining in the prayers with
        an earnestness almost frenzied. The effect was marvellous. In a
        moment the excitement passed away. Her eyes lost their wandering
        look, and, in a tone calmer and more collected than any that she had
        ever before been known to use since the time of her trouble, she
        said, showing the crimson spot to Eglah—<span class="tei tei-q">“He
        has heard my prayer; He has sprinkled me with the blood of
        cleansing.”</span> She stood silent and collected until the whole
        ritual was finished, and when the time for the hymn of thanksgiving
        came round joined her voice with a quiet happiness to the voices of
        the congregation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the people
        returned to their homes Huldah left the Temple in company with Eglah.
        But it was evident that her strength was exhausted. She could barely
        totter along with all the help that Eglah and a neighbour could give
        her, and when she came to the house of Seraiah and Ruth, which
        happened <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
        262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        lie in her way, she sank almost unconscious to the ground.
        Providentially at that moment Ruth came up with her husband and the
        little Daniel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She seemed so much better in the Temple—was quite calm
        and peaceful again—and now I am afraid that she is going to be very
        ill,”</span> said Eglah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Woman’s wit
        suggested to Ruth a happy thought for dealing with the sufferer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Leave her to me,”</span> she said. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“She was happy here once, and here, if it please the
        Lord, she will be happy again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth and her
        husband carried her into the house, and laid her upon her bed in her
        old chamber. Once there she was able to swallow a little broth which
        had been hastily prepared, cast one grateful look of recognition at
        her old mistress, and then fell into a deep sleep. The next morning
        she awoke, entirely restored to reason, and, though still somewhat
        weak, able to go about the household tasks in which she had been once
        employed, and which she resumed at once without a question, and as
        if, indeed, they had never been interrupted for a day. The three
        years of misery were entirely blotted out of her memory; nor did any
        spectre from the past ever come back to trouble her.</p>

        next act was to fortify the restored Temple. It was exposed, even
        more than the rest of the city, to a sudden attack from the garrison
        of the fort, which might work irreparable mischief could it gain,
        even for an hour, possession of the sacred building. Accordingly a
        high wall, strengthened at intervals by towers, was now erected round
        it, and a force was told off from the army to watch it. This done,
        the patriot leader could attend without anxiety to other cares. At
        Beth-zur a fortress was erected and strongly garrisoned to guard the
        Eastern frontier especially against the attacks of the Idumeans, who,
        under their new name, inherited all the old Edomite jealousy of
        Israel. After personally superintending <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the erection of this stronghold, Judas marched
        against other tribes on the east and south, who had been taking
        advantage of the troublous times to plunder their Jewish neighbours.
        The Arabs of the Negeb, or South Country, were defeated at a pass
        near the Dead Sea, which bore the appropriate name of the Pass of the
        Scorpions; the Ammonites, another tribe whose kinship with the chosen
        people seems to have embittered their hereditary enmity, were
        defeated under their Greek leader, Timotheus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile life at
        Jerusalem had been settling down into a peaceful order. The younger
        of the two priests whom Eglah had befriended had found scope for his
        energies by joining the army; Shemaiah, the elder, was again an
        inmate in the house which had sheltered him, where Eglah, who had
        never forgotten the charity with which he had spoken of her husband,
        tended him with all the care of a daughter. The old man was never
        tired of hearing the story of the two dismal years during which he
        had been in hiding.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ah, father!”</span> she said to him one day,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“you were not so ill off in your poor prison
        after all. Had you had your liberty you would have seen altars to the
        false gods in every street. And it was not safe to pass them without
        showing some sign of reverence.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how did you fare, my daughter?”</span> asked the old
        man.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name=
        "Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I could avoid them, knowing where they were, by passing
        by on the other side, and my good Glaucus—the Lord have mercy on
        him!—was always kind and helpful. He would fetch the water regularly
        from the fountain, where there was an altar to the Naiad, as they
        called the demon of the spring, which I could not have avoided. The
        people used to laugh at him for doing a woman’s work, but he did not
        heed them. O why was he taken away before he could learn the truth? I
        think that he would have known it if he could have lived a little
        longer.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the poor woman
        burst into a passion of tears. She was always haunted with this fear
        of her husband’s fate, and reproached herself with not having been
        earnest enough in speaking of the truth to her husband.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peace, my daughter,”</span> said the old man, gently;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the mercies of the Lord are without end, and
        His ways past finding out. Be sure that He will not forget the
        kindness that was showed to a daughter of Abraham. But tell
        me,”</span> he went on, anxious to change the subject—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“tell me how we came to find the courts of the Temple
        desolate and overgrown as though no one had entered them for months?
        Did you not say that there were sacrifices there, and feasts to the
        demons whom the Greeks worship?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, father; it was so for a time. But soon there were

        whom Philip the Phrygian and Apollonius—the curse of the Lord be upon
        him!—brought in to serve at the altars, went elsewhere, for, of a
        truth, they would have died of hunger had they stayed here. O father,
        it was a mournful existence; of a truth we were fed with the bread of
        affliction and the water of affliction.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they talked
        Ruth came in with a troubled face.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O Eglah!”</span> she cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        did hope that we should have peace and quiet, but there are wars and
        rumours of wars on every side. This morning letters came to the
        captain from our brethren in Gilead. That evil Timotheus—would to God
        he had not escaped out of the hand of Judas!—has gathered together a
        host of the Ammonites and slain some—a thousand, ’tis said, with
        their wives and children, and shut up the rest in the fortress of
        Dametha. And now my husband and my brother are in council with the
        captain, and I fear me much that they will be sent to the wars, for
        indeed,”</span> she added, with a touch of a woman’s pride in those
        that are dear to her, <span class="tei tei-q">“Judas esteems them
        highly, and will always have them in places of trust. Nor would I

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she spoke

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And she could say

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sunset
        exactly—for Judas was one of the commanders who are exactly and
        punctually obeyed—the two expeditions set forth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their departure
        was, of course, observed by the garrison of the fort, who were
        encouraged by it to make some fierce sallies on the diminished forces
        of the patriots. These were as fiercely repelled, and in a few days
        things settled down again into the virtual truce which had existed
        for some time between besiegers and besieged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eight days after
        the departure of the expeditions tidings of victory came from the
        main army under Judas. The captain of the host had taken Bozrah, in
        Edom. The place lay at least a hundred miles to the east; but the
        patriots had covered the distance with unexpected rapidity, and,
        reaching the place before there had been any notion of their
        approach, had taken it almost without resistance. The messenger had
        left, he said, as soon as the place was taken, but Judas had marched
        the same night to Dametha, which was in urgent need of
        relief.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
        269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day came
        in tidings of further success. Dametha and its garrison, with the
        crowd of helpless fugitives which had sought shelter within its
        walls, was safe. The night march from Bozrah had been made just in
        time. Had it been delayed till morning it might well have been too
        late. The Ammonites had chosen that very day for a fierce assault
        upon the place. Just as the day was dawning and the assailants were
        close under the walls Judas had appeared. His approach had been
        observed by the besieged, who had watched it from the citadel, but
        the assailants were taken by surprise. Hemmed in between two
        attacking forces, the garrison who made a sortie from the town and
        the army of the patriots in the rear, they had been utterly routed.
        Timotheus had barely escaped with his life, and had fled northward,
        followed by Judas in hot pursuit. A few days afterwards came the news
        that the campaign was at an end—begun and finished within the space
        of two weeks. This time the captain had found time to write a
        despatch. It ran thus:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Judas, Captain of the Lord’s host, to Azariah, greeting.
        Know that the Lord has delivered the enemy into our hands. Timotheus,
        having suffered defeat at Dametha, fled northward to a temple where
        the heathen worship the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Two-horned
        Ashtaroth,’</span> a strong place by nature and skilfully fortified.
        I judged it better that I should not spill the blood of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the people of the Lord in assaulting it,
        and so, having cleared the walls of defenders by help of my slingers,
        I surrounded it with great quantities of faggots. To these I caused
        fire to be set, nor did my slingers suffer the Ammonites to approach
        to put out the flames. In the end the whole was consumed, and
        Timotheus perished in the fire. The Lord has rewarded him according
        to his deeds. So much for what has been done: now for what remains to
        do. This country is not as yet a safe dwelling-place, and will not be
        till the heathen shall be more thoroughly subdued. It is my purpose,
        therefore, to bring the people of this land to Jerusalem. Provide, to
        the best of your ability, for their food and <span class=
        "tei tei-corr">lodging.</span> Farewell!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exultation
        felt by the people at Jerusalem when the tidings of their final
        victory reached them passes description. The times of David, they
        were sure, were about to return. The promise was once again to be
        fulfilled—<span class="tei tei-q">“He shall reign from the flood [the
        Euphrates], unto the world’s end.”</span> In the Temple chant of the
        day the words went—<span class="tei tei-q">“I will not be afraid of
        ten thousands of the people that have set themselves against me round
        about. Up, Lord, and help me, O my God, for Thou smitest all Thine
        enemies upon the cheek-bone. Thou hast broken the teeth of the
        ungodly.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when tidings
        of still further victories, won by Simon in Galilee, came in to swell
        the popular <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
        271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>enthusiasm, there was a certain change of
        feeling, something of the jealousy that almost inevitably springs up
        when great deeds are done. Joseph and Azariah chafed at the life of
        inaction which they were forced to live at Jerusalem, and what they
        thought in their hearts the soldiers did not hesitate to express
        openly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us also,”</span> so ran the
        common talk—<span class="tei tei-q">“let us also get for ourselves a
        name, and go and fight against the enemies of the Lord.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day after
        the tidings of Simon’s victories came in the two captains were waited
        upon by a deputation of soldiers, who came to urge that they might be
        relieved from the inaction to which they were condemned, an inaction
        made all the more hard to bear by the glories that were being won
        elsewhere. Azariah and Joseph listened with attention, and, indeed,
        were at no pains to hide their sympathy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The men are right,”</span> said Joseph, when the
        deputation had withdrawn. <span class="tei tei-q">“They will lose all
        heart if we keep them idling here.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In my heart I am inclined to agree with you,”</span>
        answered his colleague; <span class="tei tei-q">“but what did the
        captain say?—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Watch the garrison of the
        heathen that they do no hurt to the city and the Holy Place while we
        are away.’</span> But he said nothing of going elsewhere, and I
        should be unwilling to disobey him, for, beyond all doubt, the Lord
        is with him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, brother, you are too narrow in your <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thoughts of obeying. We obey him best if
        we do the best that we can for the cause of the Lord. And though I
        honour Judas greatly, yet he is but a captain in the Lord’s host,
        even as we are. Why should we not do as he has done? And tell me,
        Azariah,”</span> he went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you think
        that the vision which you saw when the angel of the Lord brought you
        a sword with the Name written on it has been altogether fulfilled?
        Shall this sword which he bade you use for the Lord always abide in
        the scabbard? Is this the life to which you are called?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You speak truly,”</span> said Azariah. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can scarcely be faithful to my trust if I suffer the
        sword of the Lord to rust. But tell me, what think you we had best
        do?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Gorgias,”</span> said Joseph, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is encamped at Jamnia, and does great mischief to the
        land and the people; if we can drive him out we shall earn great
        thanks both from the captain and from our brethren.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The resolution of
        the commanders was heard with unmingled delight by their men, and
        with almost equal pleasure by the inhabitants of the city. Some of
        the more cautious disapproved, and Shemaiah even made his way to the
        Governor’s house—no easy task for his scanty strength—and
        remonstrated with Azariah. <span class="tei tei-q">“My son,”</span>
        said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“your strength is to sit still. Make
        not too much speed, and be not over-bold.”</span> He was listened to
        with respect, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
        273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even
        with some compunction on Azariah’s part. But it seemed too late to
        retreat. To hold back now would infallibly give rise to the charge of
        cowardice, and Azariah, brave as a lion against all outward danger,
        had not the rare moral courage which would have enabled him to face
        such an accusation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sunrise on the
        day after the resolution had been taken, the expedition set out with
        confident expectation of victory, and watched from the walls by an
        eager multitude. At sunset a miserable remnant came straggling back
        into the city. They had fared, as their fathers had fared many
        centuries before, when, with the like unauthorized daring, they had
        assaulted the hill fortress of Ai, and had returned, bringing
        discouragement with them. Gorgias had sallied out from his hill
        fortress, had charged the Jewish force with full advantage of the
        ground, and had driven them in headlong flight before them. Azariah
        and Joseph had done all that leaders could do to turn the tide of
        battle, but their efforts had been in vain. Two thousand men had
        fallen, the wounded being, perforce, left to the mercy or cruelty of
        the enemy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was
        filled with mourning for the dead; and, of course, there was a rapid
        revulsion of feeling against the leaders whose rash action had ended
        in such disaster. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are these men,”</span>
        was the general cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“who have caused the
        people of the Lord to perish? They are not of the seed of those by
        whose hand deliverance is given to Israel.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The heathen in the
        fort observed the return as they had observed the departure of the
        expedition that had ended so disastrously. Their sallies became
        fiercer and more frequent, and Azariah, his forces weakened by the
        loss of two thousand men, found it difficult to repel them. Nothing
        could have exceeded the energy with which he devoted himself to this
        duty, or the courage with which he executed it. Night and day he was
        at his post, for it was here only that he found a refuge from the
        anguish and doubt which tormented him; here only the reproaches of
        the widows of the slain could not follow him. He allowed himself no
        rest; sleep he seemed absolutely to do without, and food he hastily
        snatched at any moment when the opportunity offered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One remission only
        from this task he allowed himself, and this because it was a duty. He
        paid a daily visit to his children. They, too, poor little souls, had
        not escaped a share in the trouble. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>life which they had led for the last two years
        had developed their understanding beyond their age, and they felt, if
        they did not fully appreciate, their father’s unhappiness. One
        consolation they had, the care of two little orphans—the father had
        fallen in the expedition, and the mother had been struck down by the
        news of her husband’s death—who had been taken into the house and put
        under the charge of the elderly kinswoman who looked after Azariah’s
        household.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On one of these
        occasions he found the aged Shemaiah. His first impulse was to avoid
        the old man, but a few words of sympathy overcame him; his
        self-control broke down, and hiding his face in his robe he shed the
        rare and painful tears of a man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the first
        outburst of grief was over he spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tell me, father, why has God forsaken His servant who
        trusted in Him. I went out in faith—and see the end. Would that I had
        died in the battle!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My son, may it not be that you tempted the Lord? Did you
        count the cost when you went forth against Gorgias, whether you had
        force sufficient for the attack, or skill to handle it?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Does faith, then, go for nothing? Had Judas men enough,
        as soldiers reckon in such matters, or skill enough, seeing that he
        had had no experience in war, when he overthrew Apollonius?

        id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Yet the Lord gave him the
        victory because he trusted in Him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My son, God gave the victory to Judas, having first
        given him not strength only and courage, but skill also and
        understanding. He gives not the same gifts to all: to Moses wisdom
        and learning, but to Aaron eloquent speech; to David the arts of war,
        but to Solomon the arts of peace. Think you that because you are a
        servant of the Lord, you are therefore to choose the service that you
        will do? You would be captain of the Lord’s host like Judas. Would
        you also indite psalms with David, and devise proverbs with Solomon?
        The Spirit of the Lord divideth to every man severally as He will. To
        Mattathias He gave discernment to see in Judas the leader and
        commander of the people, and the people were obedient to him. And so
        Judas discerned in you one who might be entrusted with the defence of
        the city, but not with the warfare against the heathen that are
        without. This was your service, but you were not content with it.
        Think not that the Lord has forgotten you, but rather that you have
        left the place in which you were set.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was plain
        speaking, but given with such gentleness and sympathy that the rebuke
        healed more than it wounded. Humbled yet comforted, Azariah returned
        to his post before the fortress. But he could not forget that his
        great trial was yet to come. Nor was it long delayed. The next day
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277"
        id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it was evident that something
        was happening that had attracted the attention of the garrison. The
        highest tower was crowded with soldiers who were intently watching
        something that could not be seen from below. And indeed it was a
        remarkable spectacle. Judas was returning with his victorious army,
        escorting at the same time a vast crowd of non-combatants, men,
        women, and children, the whole population of the country beyond
        Jordan, which could no longer be inhabited with safety, and all
        Jerusalem had gone out to meet the champion. Then, in a moment, the
        tower was deserted, the gates were thrown open, and a furious sortie,
        the last that could be attempted with any hope of success, was made
        with the whole force of the garrison. It was with a desperate courage
        that Azariah repelled the attack. Never had he exposed himself so
        recklessly. He could almost have wished to fall in the fight; for now
        the dreaded meeting was at hand, and he had to render up to his chief
        the trust which he had so abused. The attack was repelled, and then
        Azariah had to remain in an inaction that was almost unbearable till
        he should be summoned to the interview with his chief.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was just
        setting when a soldier presented himself, and, after saluting, said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The general seeks you.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Has he summoned the council?”</span> asked Azariah, who
        dreaded a public censure.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        is alone.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And Azariah
        followed him to the captain’s house, with such a tremor in his heart
        as no dangers of battle had ever caused.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What followed at
        the meeting was never known, save as far as the result was concerned.
        Shemaiah was awaiting his return, and the first glance showed the old
        man that things had gone well with his friend. The burden of trouble
        was gone. Azariah looked brighter and more cheerful—so great is the
        force of reaction—than he had done since he had lost his Hannah.
        Shemaiah felt that there was no need to question him, and waited in
        silence for what his friend should please to tell him. What he heard
        was this:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The captain would have kept me in the office to which he

        him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘O my lord, let me rather go with you.

        the river, nor lost one of your own people. But I, going in the
        presumption of my heart to a warfare unto which I was not sent, have
        accomplished nothing; I have wrought no deliverance for my people,
        and the bones of two thousand of my brethren lie scattered on the
        plain. Henceforth I am but a sword in the hand of the servant of the
        Lord.’</span> But the captain said nothing. Let it be as he will. As
        for me, I am content, for I know that he has pardoned me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever the kind
        of service in which Judas might see fit to employ his lieutenant, it
        was clear that there would be no lack of work for him to do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The victories of
        Judas in Gilead had been followed by successes won by Simon in
        Galilee. And from Galilee, as from Gilead, there had been a great
        migration of the inhabitants, who sought in Jerusalem a safer home
        than they could find in their own country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, at the
        head of a more powerful army than he had hitherto been able to
        collect, Judas set out. His first object was Hebron, which had for
        some time past been in the possession of the Idumeans. He took it by
        assault; it might almost be said, so unexpected was his coming, by
        surprise. Indeed, one cause of his success was the extraordinary
        rapidity and secrecy of his movements. Almost the moment that his
        plans were formed, he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
        280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was
        on his way to execute them. Even if there had been traitors or spies
        in his camp—and such were almost unknown—any information which they
        could send to the enemy was outstripped, so to speak, by his action.
        Hebron had to be abandoned after its capture, for he could not spare
        a sufficient garrison to hold it. All that could be done was to take
        care that it should not, for some time at least, become a stronghold
        of the enemy. Its citadel was destroyed; the towers on the wall
        burnt, and a furlong of the wall itself broken down.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Hebron the
        Jewish leader marched southward, and then turning eastward invaded
        the country of the Philistines. Azotus, which was supposed to be safe
        on account of its maritime position, and was, in consequence,
        negligently guarded, was assaulted with success, and its temples and
        altars destroyed, though Gorgias was still in force at Jamnia, only
        nine miles to the north. Several of the smaller Philistine towns were
        taken on the return march to Jerusalem; and altogether this people
        received a lesson which they were not likely soon to forget. All this
        was accomplished with very little loss. Joel, the priest, however,
        was killed at Azotus, where he had recklessly exposed himself in the
        attack.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great as was the
        popular rejoicing at these victories, it was nothing to the
        exultation caused by the next tidings that reached
        Jerusalem—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg

        return of the army a Syrian runner was caught while endeavouring to
        make his way into the fortress through the lines of the besiegers. He
        had been sent by Lysias with a despatch to the commander of the
        garrison. The document was of the briefest. It ran thus:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man, when
        questioned by Judas and the council, was able to supplement the bare
        news of the King’s death with some interesting details. He had had
        some talk with the messenger who had brought the tidings to Antioch,
        and had heard all that was as yet known. His story ran thus:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King was in Persia when he heard how his armies had
        been defeated, not once or twice only, in the land of Judæa. Great
        was his rage—so great that for the space of three or four hours none
        dared to come near him. Then he summoned his counsellors to him, and
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will destroy this nation of rebels
        till there shall be not one of them left,’</span> and giving up all
        other plans he marched westward <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>with all his army. But on his way he came to the
        city of Elymaïs, where there is a temple, the treasury of which is
        reputed to be more wealthy than any in the whole land of Persia, for
        it has never been spoiled within the memory of man. Even the great
        Alexander left it untouched, adding also much of the spoil which he
        had taken himself. This temple the father of the King had sought to
        plunder; but the people of the city rose against him, and drove him
        away. When the King came to this city he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Here is another nest of rebels. Did they not rise
        against the King, my father? Verily I will avenge his memory upon
        them.’</span> So he went into the city, having some five hundred
        soldiers with him. And the magistrates received him with honour. And
        when he said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I would see your temple and
        its treasures,’</span> they consented. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Only,’</span> they said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘it is
        our custom that no armed man may come within the precincts.’</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Will you strip me of my sword?’</span> said
        the King. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Not so,’</span> they answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘but your followers must be without any, and
        not more than ten in number.’</span> When the King heard this he was
        greatly wroth, and said to the magistrates of the city, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘I will come in despite of you.’</span> So he went, he
        and his five hundred, to the square in which the temple stands. But
        he found the whole place filled with an armed multitude, and when he
        would have forced his way into the precincts he was beaten back,
        losing not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg
        283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        few of his soldiers, and being himself struck on the head with a
        stone. After this, whether it was from his rage, which became more
        terrible than ever, or from any other cause, I know not; but the King
        was smitten with some disease, and could no longer ride, as he had
        been wont, but was carried in a litter. And they say that the stench
        of his wounds was so great that the men who bore the litter could
        scarcely endure it, but were changed continually. So they brought him
        to Tabol, in the land of Persia, and there he died, being terribly
        tormented with pain. And I heard that when he was dying, he cried out
        with a most lamentable voice repenting him of the wrong that he had
        done against the gods in robbing their temples.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of what did he speak?”</span> asked one of the
        council.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said the man, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
        I know not. Some said that he spoke of this Temple in Jerusalem, and
        some that it was the temple in Elymaïs, where men worship the
        moon-goddess, that was in his mind. But more I do not
        know.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas rose up in
        his place and repeated the last words of that great triumphal chant
        in which more than a thousand years before Deborah and Barak had
        celebrated the overthrow of another king who had mightily oppressed

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A time was now
        approaching to which the responsible leaders of the people looked
        forward, for the most part, with great anxiety. This was the
        Sabbatical year. During a whole twelve months it would not be lawful
        to carry on any offensive war, or, a far more serious matter, to till
        the ground. Debate ran high as to whether the Law could be observed
        in its strictness. There were many who asked, with no little show of
        reason, <span class="tei tei-q">“Will it be possible in times so
        troublous to keep a year of rest? Moses, when he commanded it,
        thought of a people dwelling quietly in a land from which they had
        driven out all their enemies. As things are now, these enemies are
        about us, and even in the very midst of us. And then the harvest?
        Will it suffice to feed the people, already more than twice as
        numerous as in the previous year, and daily
        increasing?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg
        285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer of the
        Chasidim was peremptory. <span class="tei tei-q">“For what,”</span>
        they asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“have we suffered and fought? For
        what did the martyrs lay down their lives—Eleazar the priest, and the
        mother and her sons, and Hannah, the wife of Azariah, and others
        without number? For what did Mattathias wear out the remnant of his
        years? Was it not for the Law, that it might be kept whole and
        undefiled? Might we not have lived in peace, and stood high in favour
        with the King, if we had been content to forsake the law of the Lord
        our God? And now that He has given us the victory, and delivered us
        from the hand of the heathen, so that we may serve Him without fear,
        shall we cast His commandments behind our backs? Were we not few in
        number, and scarcely armed, and yet did He not give into our hands
        great armies, well equipped with shield and sword and spear? Were we
        not well-nigh perishing of hunger among the mountains, and did He not
        richly supply our needs? Surely the earth is the Lord’s and the
        fulness thereof, and, if He will, He can make that which it bringeth
        forth of itself to abound even as the fields which the sower has
        sowed and the reaper has reaped?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the Chasidim
        had their way, as zealous men are wont to have it, when they know
        exactly their own minds and what they want. The Sabbatical year was
        proclaimed. There was to be no labour, no ploughing or sowing, no
        tendance of oliveyards <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg
        286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        vineyards. The people were to live simply and wholly on the bounty of
        the earth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first month of
        the Sabbatical year itself bore the name of the Sabbatical month.
        Into this were crowded three of the great feasts and celebrations of
        the year—the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast
        of Tabernacles. But the whole year was to be one round of religious
        celebrations. To the daily sacrifices in the Temple were added
        special services of intercession, praise, and thanksgiving. Nor did
        the Temple-worship alone satisfy the religious wants of the people.
        The synagogues were thronged, and that not on the Sabbath only but on
        every day of the week. The Law and the Prophets were read and
        expounded, not, we may be sure, without many stirring references to
        the events of the day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this religious
        enthusiasm was wanted to support the people under the hardships of
        the time. Provisions, if they did not actually run short, began to
        rise in price. Judas and his council did their best to prevent it;
        but the selfish instincts of the possessors of corn could not be
        overcome; stores were held back from the market, and the poorer
        class, swollen as it was in numbers by the great immigration of the
        preceding year from Gilead and Galilee, began to suffer
        seriously.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        insolence of the Greek garrison was increasing daily. The Jewish
        soldiers contented <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg
        287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>themselves, or endeavoured to content
        themselves, with repelling attack. This meant, of course, standing
        exposed to showers of missiles which they could not return, and it
        tried their patience to the uttermost. Even some of the Chasidim were
        heard to murmur that there must be some limits to this endurance;
        among the besiegers in general, who had not risen to the height of
        Chasidim zeal, a spirit of discontent was growing up that might well
        have become dangerous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before long,
        however, the evil worked its own cure. One sabbath-day, about the
        beginning of the month which we should call November, there was a
        great solemnity in the Temple, and the outposts of the besieging
        force had been more than usually weakened. Ruth, with her little
        Daniel and her two nieces, was going towards the Temple, escorted by
        her husband and Micah, when one of the lower gates of the fortress
        was suddenly thrown open, and a party of Greeks rushed out upon the
        party. Seraiah and Micah were both armed, but for some minutes they
        had to make head against their assailants alone. One of the soldiers
        who had seized Ruth was promptly felled to the earth by a blow from
        Micah’s sword; and Seraiah did similar execution on another. But the
        odds were too great for them. Micah was brought to the ground, and it
        was only by desperate efforts that his brother-in-law could save him
        from being stabbed as he lay. Ruth, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>meanwhile, being left without help, was carried
        off to the very gates of the fortress. And then, just before it was
        too late, came the longed-for help. The two girls, who, with their
        little cousin, had been some distance behind, ran screaming towards
        the Temple, and happily met with their father, who was just about to
        change guard at one of the posts. He and his company ran at the top
        of their speed to the scene of the conflict, plunged recklessly
        through the missiles which were showered on them from the fortress,
        and reached the wall at the same moment with the ravishers, whose
        progress was impeded by the struggles of the captive, for, brave
        woman as she was, she never lost her presence of mind. A few of the
        party escaped into the fortress, the nearest gate of which was
        cautiously opened to receive them; but the greater number were
        instantly put to the sword. Ruth, whose strength broke down when she
        knew that she was safe, was carried home, sorely bruised and
        half-unconscious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas was
        profoundly moved when he heard of this outrage. He had long been
        chafing under the restrictions imposed upon his action by his rigid
        supporters, and this determined him to break through them. He had a
        great affection for Azariah and his kindred. The men were known to
        him for their loyalty and courage, and Ruth as an indefatigable
        worker among the sick and wounded. His resolution was taken, but with
        the prudence and soundness of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>judgment that were habitual to him he was
        careful to avoid any appearance of being peremptory or self-willed.
        He called to him one of his lieutenants, who was reputed to be a
        leader among the Chasidim.</p>

        when the heathen seek to carry our wives and our children into
        captivity, nor will I lay upon the people a burden that the Lord has
        not laid upon them. If I sin in this matter, let the punishment fall
        upon me and upon my father’s house.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micaiah was not
        altogether content, but he did not feel sufficiently convinced to

        assembly of the soldiers was held, and Judas informed them that
        operations would be more vigorously conducted for the future. The
        announcement was received with great satisfaction, even by the
        stricter partisans of the Law. The insolence of the garrison was
        summarily checked. The sallies on which it ventured were repulsed so
        fiercely that they were soon discontinued, while relays of archers
        and slingers, succeeding each other without intermission from
        earliest dawn to nightfall, kept the walls clear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though this
        difficulty was surmounted others not less serious remained. The
        privations resulting from the observance of the Sabbatical year were
        such as to overtask the endurance of all but enthusiasts. And, of
        course, under these circumstances it was inevitable that the
        regulations should be evaded. Huldah, with the children, was
        wandering one day among the gardens in the neighbourhood of the city.
        They were searching for some fruit for Ruth who was now making a very
        slow recovery from the injuries which she had received. They were at
        liberty to go where they pleased, for all right of property was at an
        end, at least for the time. But others had been before them, and it
        seemed as if everything had been gathered, even before it was
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291"
        id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ripe. They were returning home
        with but the scantiest results from this toil when they witnessed a
        scene of uproar. Some men had been discovered by the officers of the
        chief priests in the unlawful act of cultivating the ground. They had
        been sowing the seeds of some quick-growing plants, doing it in such
        an irregular fashion that what came up might seem to have been
        chance-sown, but they had been detected, and were now being led off
        in custody, angry and defiant, and loudly condemning the bigoted
        folly which, as they said, to carry out an obsolete enactment,
        condemned a whole people to starvation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A crowd speedily
        gathered and followed the officers and their prisoners to the house
        of one of the chief priests. Huldah and the children went with it.
        The case was tried, in Eastern fashion, in the open air and in
        public. The process was short, for the offenders had been caught in
        the act, and the law which they had transgressed was plain. The
        defence which they attempted on the plea of necessity was cut short
        by the judge. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Word of God,”</span> said
        he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is of more account than meat and drink.
        Take these men,”</span> he went on, speaking to an officer whom we
        should call the provost-marshal, <span class="tei tei-q">“and see
        that they suffer each forty stripes save one. And you,”</span> he
        added, turning to the prisoners, <span class="tei tei-q">“know that
        if you offend again in this matter you shall be stoned with stones
        till you die.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
        292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The men were bound
        and flogged. That was a sight which Huldah and the children did not
        wait to see; but just as they were reaching their home the men passed
        them, furious at the indignity which they had suffered, and loudly
        proclaiming their determination to be revenged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning
        they were missing from the city. A porter at one of the smaller gates
        was found tied and gagged. He said that he had been attacked by a
        party of men, some of whom could be identified by his description
        with the sufferers of the day before. The others were Greeks,
        apparently belonging to the garrison. They had surprised him, taken
        his keys from him, and had gone—so he judged from something that he
        had overheard—on the road to Antioch. This gave a serious aspect to
        the affair. The men had evidently deserted, and would put all the
        information that they had at the service of the enemy. Judas
        immediately ordered a pursuit. But though the party that he sent out
        was more than once close upon the tracks of the fugitives it did not
        succeed in overtaking them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time went on. The
        Feast of the Dedication came round, and was kept with as much
        cheerfulness as the depressed spirits and scanty means of the people
        permitted. Spring succeeded winter, bringing with it in its milder
        temperature and in the abundance of its natural growths some
        alleviations of the common suffering. But the prospect, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as a whole, was scarcely brighter. It was
        almost a relief when tidings reached the city that a struggle was at
        hand. It was better, thought many, to die on the field of battle than
        to sit still and starve. And, indeed, death on the battle-field
        seemed a likely prospect. Lysias, who had been making his
        preparations during the whole of the winter, was now, it was said,
        about to set forth. The force which he had under his command was
        reported to be overwhelmingly strong, numbering not less than 120,000
        men. It was also said that he had with him thirty-two war-elephants.
        The boy-King—Eupator was not more than nine years old—was also said
        to be with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas met the
        danger with his accustomed resolution. He waited in the city till he
        could be certain of the road which the invaders were taking. As soon
        as he knew that it was from the south that they were approaching, he
        collected all his available force, having for the purpose to raise
        the siege of the fortress, and marched forth to meet them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fortress of
        Beth-zur, which was intended to be the first line in the defence of
        the capital, was in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy.
        Micah had received, early in the year, a commission to revictual it,
        but had found the task one that was difficult, if not impossible, to
        execute. There was a positive scarcity of food, and the scarcity was
        aggravated as usual by the practice of hoarding. It was to little
        purpose that Micah scoured the country, making requisitions of grain
        and other supplies. Some few, strong in their faith, gave up what
        they had, and committed themselves and their children to the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295"
        id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lord, whose law they were
        seeking to obey. Others met the demand with a flat refusal, and at
        the same time taunted Micah with the folly of enforcing an
        impracticable law in times of such difficulty. Many met him with the
        plea of poverty, and their wasted forms and sunken faces were proof
        enough that this plea was genuine. The work, therefore, for all the
        zeal that Micah displayed, went on but very slowly, and, indeed, was
        not half finished when the advanced guard of the army of Lysias
        appeared. Beth-zur was immediately invested. The engines, of which
        Lysias had a large stock, played fiercely upon the walls, and
        preparations was made for an assault. Micah, on the other hand, saw
        no hope that he would be able to stand a long siege. The garrison
        under his command was not large enough adequately to man the walls,
        while it was too large for the stock of provisions which he had been
        able to collect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
        circumstances his resolution was soon taken. Before dawn on the
        second day of the investment the whole garrison made a desperate
        sally. Happily they had no non-combatants to care for, and as yet no
        sick or wounded. Fire was set to the engines. The besiegers, thinking
        that this was the object of the attack, and that the garrison would
        make their way back into the fortress, when this had been
        accomplished, occupied themselves chiefly in putting out the fire.
        But Micah had no intention of returning. He availed himself of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296"
        id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>confusion caused by the burning
        of the camp, cut his way with desperate resolution through the enemy,
        and succeeded in reaching the camp of Judas with the larger part of
        his force. The rest were not able to follow him, but succeeded in
        regaining the fortress, which they continued to hold against the
        Greeks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The camp was at
        Beth-Zachariah, about nine miles south from Jerusalem, and on an
        elevated position, not less than three thousand feet above the level
        of the sea, which commanded the whole of the neighbouring country.
        Behind, to the north, could be seen the towers of Jerusalem, with
        Bethlehem, the City of David, in the nearer foreground, nestling
        among its oliveyards and vineyards. To the west lay the plain of
        Philistia, with the white cliff of Gath clearly visible in the
        extreme distance; to the east could be seen the purple mountains of
        Moab. The road from Hebron, by which the Greek army would approach,
        crept along the eastern side of the mountains. From his elevated
        position Judas could see the movements of his adversaries while they
        were still at a considerable distance. Observing that they pitched
        their camp on the further side of a narrow defile, with the character
        of which he was intimately acquainted, he conceived the idea of an
        ambush.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He summoned
        Azariah to his tent and detailed his plan. Azariah also knew the
        place well, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg
        297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>entered into the scheme with enthusiasm—such
        enthusiasm, indeed, that Judas felt it necessary to give him a
        parting caution. <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“if this scheme fails, that you come back to
        me immediately. If the ambush should be discovered, retreat at once.
        There must be no attack. I cannot spare a man. We shall want all that
        we have, if not more than all, to make head against the thousands of
        Lysias.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah promised
        obedience, and lost no time in setting out on his errand. Shortly
        after sunset he started, having with him a picked force of a thousand
        men. Before midnight he had reached the place fixed upon by Judas,
        and there, in a hollow half-way up the side of the hill that formed
        one side of the pass, he laid his ambush.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was an anxious
        night for the little band. It was always an accepted maxim in ancient
        warfare that it was the most steadfast courage that was wanted for
        the ambush. Men who were brave enough when fighting in the open plain
        found their courage fail when they had to lie for hours watching for
        the moment of attack, crouched upon the ground, unable to move and
        scarcely venturing to talk. Azariah’s men were brave—indeed they had
        been carefully chosen for this very service—but they were not
        altogether insensible of the dangers of their position. They knew,
        too, and even exaggerated the strength of the advancing army. As
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298"
        id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they talked in whispers during
        the night, for, as may be imagined, few could sleep, they spoke of
        the chances of the coming day. The elephants, which had never before
        been seen on Jewish soil, were mentioned with special awe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Strange and terrible beasts they are,”</span> said one
        man to his neighbour; <span class="tei tei-q">“savage as lions, and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        rousing them to fury before the battle.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        King Antiochus, father to the madman whom the Lord smote for his
        sins, had an array of them in his army when he fought against the
        Romans at Magnesia, but they profited him little. So Simeon told
        me—you know the man, the old Benjamite who took service with the
        King. The Romans stood firm in their rank, and threw their javelins
        at the beasts’ trunks, and in the end, so Simeon said, they did more
        damage to their own people than to the enemy.”</span></p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Lord grant that it be so to-morrow.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun had just
        risen when the approach of the Greek army became visible. And now the
        vanguard was almost within striking distance of the ambush which, to
        all appearance, was still undiscovered. Another few steps and they
        would be immediately below, at a point where they might be assailed
        with disastrous effect. Behind a little rock which was within a few
        yards of the pass Azariah knelt, sword in hand, waiting to give the
        signal to his men. Their fears had mostly vanished in the morning
        light, and the dreaded elephants did not form part of the advanced
        guard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But just as
        Azariah was about to give the signal to charge his quick ear caught
        the sound of tramping feet, which seemed to come from some place
        above his own position. The next moment he caught sight, in the
        slanting rays of the early sun, of the glitter of helmets and
        shields. A Greek force, fully equal in number to his own, was
        marching in a direction parallel to the pass but higher up the
        mountain-side. Lysias had learnt wisdom from experience. He no longer
        despised his enemy, but credited him with the military skill which,
        indeed, he had more than once proved himself to possess. He had
        foreseen the ambush, and had sent a force to guard against the
        danger. Azariah’s force, though out of sight of the road, could be
        seen from the higher ground, and the Greeks greeted their
        appear<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name=
        "Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ance with shouts of
        laughter. For one moment a wild desire to charge swept through the
        mind of the Jewish captain. He had hoped to blot out by some
        brilliant service the remembrance of his former disaster, and now he
        had failed again. True, it was not by his own fault; yet he had
        failed, and he would have to go back to Judas empty-handed. A single
        word would have sent his men in furious onset against the foe. Should
        he say it? Then there came back to his recollection the gentleness
        and forbearance of Judas. He could not disobey such a leader a second
        time. He gave the signal to retreat. His men heard it with disgust;
        but they knew that he was acting against his own desire as much as
        against theirs, and they obeyed without a murmur, or, if some of the
        youngest and fiercest among them complained of the order, it was only
        under their breath that they spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah now made
        his way to Judas with all the haste that he could use.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have failed,”</span> he said. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The heathen seemed to know of our design beforehand.
        There could be no surprise, so I did not attack, but came back to you
        at once.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have done well,”</span> said Judas, who knew what a
        sacrifice the fiery soldier had made. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        chance victory won by disobeying orders is worse than a
        defeat.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Judas, though,
        as always, he did full justice <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to his lieutenant, was much depressed by the
        failure of the attempt, and he looked with a gloomy brow at the
        approaching host, as it came on in all the pomp and circumstance of
        war, the sunlight gleaming on the banners, the helmets of brass and
        gold, and on the long, slanting lines of spear-heads. As it came
        nearer the regular tread of the columns and the clang of arms, with
        now and then the shrill voice of a clarion or the deep note of a
        trumpet heard above the roar, moved even the stoutest warrior to
        something like fear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas followed
        once more the tactics which he had so often found successful. To
        stand on the defensive was hopeless; his few thousands would
        inevitably be trodden down under the feet of this huge multitude. His
        only hope was in attack. If he could but break the line at a single
        point his success might be again, as it had been before, the
        beginning of a panic, and the great host of Lysias might melt away as
        the host of Apollonius had melted; but the attack must be made while
        the enemy were yet upon ground where they had not space to make full
        use of their numbers. He charged with his accustomed fury before the
        vanguard of the enemy had emerged into the open. For a time it seemed
        as if his audacity was to be successful. The hostile army reeled
        under the shock of the patriots’ furious charge. In two or three
        places it broke. But there was in reserve a second line of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302"
        id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>veterans, the steadiest and
        best troops that could be found in the Syrian armies, for Lysias knew
        by this time that none but the very best could stand against Judas
        and his Ironsides. And then the numbers were overpowering. Step by
        step the Jewish column was forced back. They left six hundred of the
        enemy dead on the field behind them; but the attack had failed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as the Greek
        army deployed upon the open ground which the retreat of the Jews left
        open to them, the elephants came upon the scene—the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“huge, earth-shaking beasts,”</span> which even the
        hardiest warrior could hardly see for the first time without some
        sinking of heart. Each animal was accompanied by picked bodies of
        horse and foot. Each carried a tower from which skilful marksmen,
        whose accurate aim was greatly helped by their elevated position,
        hurled missiles upon the ranks of the foe. The creatures themselves
        seemed to share in all the fury of the battle. They trumpeted loudly
        and furiously; at the bidding of the Indian drivers who were perched
        upon their necks they seized soldiers from among the Jewish ranks
        with their trunks, whirled them aloft, and then dashed them down,
        mangled and lifeless corpses, upon the ground.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then was done one
        of the heroic acts which stand out conspicuously on the pages of
        history. Eleazar, one of the Maccabee brothers, saw how his
        country<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name=
        "Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>men were being
        demoralized by the terror of these strange adversaries, and felt that
        it was a crisis that called for personal devotion. One of the
        elephants was conspicuous among the rest, not only for its superior
        size but for the splendour of its equipment. He felt sure that it
        must be the one that carried the boy-King himself. Immediately his
        resolve was taken. He made his way, striking furiously right and
        left, and dealing death with every blow, through the Syrian ranks,
        crept under the huge beast, and dealt him a mortal wound. Like
        another Samson, he perished by his own success. The creature fell
        with a suddenness that gave him no opportunity of escape, and he was
        crushed to death by its weight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hero did not
        accomplish his object, to rally his countrymen. One might rather say
        that their panic was heightened by the fall of one of the heroic
        brothers, a son of the great house to which they owed their liberty.
        But his deed was not forgotten. The fourth of the Maccabee brothers
        lived in the history of his people as Eleazar Avaran—Eleazar
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Beast Slayer.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the battle was
        lost beyond all hope. The only thing left for Judas was to save as
        much as he could out of the wreck. He sounded the signal for retreat,
        drew off his men in good order, and, making his way back as rapidly
        as possible to Jerusalem, threw himself into the Temple fortress,
        resolved to stand a siege.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a time the
        prospects of the patriots seemed dark indeed. Beth-zur had fallen,
        and the only hope of the cause was in the Temple fortress. This was
        fiercely assailed by the garrison of the Greek stronghold of Mount
        Zion on the one side, and, on the other, by the army which had been
        victorious at Beth-Zachariah, and which now occupied the Lower City.
        The Temple fortress was strong; it was fairly well supplied with
        munitions of war; and the garrison was large—indeed, almost too large
        for the accommodation of the place. The fatal weakness of the
        position was the scanty supply of provisions. Only water was
        abundant, for the unsparing toil of former generations had provided
        for this want; had it not been for this the resistance of the
        garrison must very soon have come to an end, for food was scarce—so
        scarce, indeed, that the strength of the fighting men could hardly be
        maintained by the in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
        305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sufficient rations which were doled out to them,
        while the few non-combatants received barely enough to keep body and
        soul together.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condition of
        the Jewish population of the city was not as bad as might have been
        expected. The cruelties of the days of Apollonius and Philip were not
        repeated; for Lysias, who, as guardian of the boy-King, was
        practically supreme, favoured a policy of conciliation, and did his
        best to repress outrage. Indeed he sanctioned the establishment of
        what may be called a municipal guard or militia, which, while under
        obligation to give no assistance to the garrison of the Temple, was
        permitted to protect the peaceful inhabitants of the city. This guard
        was under the command of Seraiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was much, of
        course, that it was difficult for those to bear who looked to Judas
        and his brothers as the hope of Israel. Menelaüs had returned, and
        with him a whole troop of renegade Jews, whose insolence and impiety
        sorely tried the patience of the faithful population. And the
        scarcity of food was only less severe in the city than it was in the
        fortress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some time
        Seraiah’s own household continued to receive mysterious supplies from
        some unknown source, which made them far more comfortable than their
        neighbours. Once a week, or even oftener, they would find a bag of
        corn or flour, a basket of dried grapes or other fruits, a bundle of
        salt fish, a string <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg
        306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        doves or wood-pigeons, put in an outhouse, nor could they guess who
        their benefactor could be. But when this had gone on for nearly two
        months, the secret came out. Seraiah, returning from his military
        duties at an early hour in the morning, and entering by a little
        postern gate in order to avoid disturbing the household, saw a man
        drop from the garden wall. He seized him by the arm, and the
        stranger, turning sharply round, revealed the well-known features of
        Benjamin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What do you here?”</span> he asked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am come on an errand of my own,”</span> answered the

        <span class="tei tei-q">“but take my word—and I would not lie to you

        yours.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A thought flashed

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        more of these gifts, for I cannot receive them. I would not have my
        Judge say to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘When thou sawest a thief,
        thou consentedst unto him.’</span> I had sooner die of hunger—aye,
        and what is far worse, see my children die—than take that which has
        not been lawfully acquired.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As you will have it,”</span> said Benjamin; <span class=

        better man. But meanwhile, the world being what it is, you and yours
        will have a hard time of it;”</span> and he turned to go away.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And the captain,”</span> he went
        on—<span class="tei tei-q">“how does he fare? I hear that things are
        not going well with him. ’Tis a thousand pities, for a braver man
        never handled sword.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seraiah told him
        briefly the story of recent events, and described the present
        condition of affairs, the other listening with an eager attention,
        and breaking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg
        308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        now and then with an exclamation of wonder and admiration.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come, Benjamin,”</span> he said, when he had finished,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“why will you not throw in your lot with us?
        Things look dark just now; but they will brighten. He who has helped
        us so far will not desert us now.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said the man, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        would gladly follow the captain, whether he led me to life or to
        death. No man could ask a better lot than to be his soldier. But I
        like not all that are with him. They are over-strict, and make no
        allowance for such as have not their zeal. Once they beat me; another
        time they had stoned me to death but that I slipped out of their
        hands; and both for some miserable trifles which no man of sense
        would care about. No, sir; Judas I honour and love, but these bigots
        who give a man no peace I cannot away with. And now the day is
        beginning to break, and I must go. I am sorry that you will not take
        my poor gifts.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next moment he
        had disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now came a
        time of grievous trouble for Ruth and her young charges, for she had
        naturally taken charge of Azariah’s two daughters. She did not
        question her husband’s refusal to share any longer the illicit gains
        of Benjamin, but she could not shut her eyes to the fact that the
        children were suffering grievously. For herself she could endure, as
        women can; the girls, too, were old enough to understand <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the cause of their suffering, though they
        could not enter into the reasons of what seemed so strange an
        observance—the Sabbatical year; but little Daniel was too young to
        know much beyond the fact that he was always terribly hungry, and
        though he was often brave enough to check his crying when he saw how
        it distressed his mother, there were times when the pangs of hunger
        were more than he could bear in silence. Poor Ruth denied herself
        everything but the few scraps that were absolutely necessary to keep
        body and soul together, and her physical weakness did not make it
        easier to keep up her hope and courage. Her hardest task, perhaps,
        was to hide, as far as it was possible, the true state of things from
        her husband. His strength must be kept up, for so much depended upon
        it; but the children, not to speak of herself, had to have their
        scanty share diminished that it might be so. This, of course, he was
        not allowed to know, and Ruth was at her wits’ end again and again to
        keep it from him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within the Temple
        fortress, meanwhile, things had become almost desperate. A few
        shekels’ weight of flour was given out to each man daily, for Judas
        insisted that all should share alike. That even this scanty allowance
        might hold out the longer, numbers of the garrison made their escape
        every night under the cover of darkness that the remainder might
        prolong their resistance for yet a few days more.</p><span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before long came a
        time when absolutely nothing was left. <span class="tei tei-q">“Their
        vessels were without victuals,”</span> and Judas and the few that
        still remained with him met to hold a final deliberation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My friends,”</span> said the great captain, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you see the straits into which we are brought. There is
        no need to tell you of them, or to prove by words what we all know
        too well in fact. What, then, shall we do? Shall we stay here and
        perish slowly by hunger, or shall we fall upon our swords, or shall
        we sally forth from the gates, and, having slain as many of the
        heathen as we may, so perish ourselves? I had hoped that the Lord
        would give deliverance to Israel by my hand, and by the hand of my
        brothers. But if it be not so, His will be done. For He is not shut
        up to do that which it pleaseth Him by one man or another. He can
        call whomsoever He will, and give him strength for the
        work.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He paused for a
        moment, and Azariah broke in, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is well
        said, O captain of the host. The Lord hath helped His people
        hitherto, and He will help them to the end. Only let us trust in Him,
        for”</span>—and here, with an impetuous gesture, he struck his foot
        upon the rock—<span class="tei tei-q">“they that put their trust in
        the Lord shall be even as this mountain, which may not be removed,
        but standeth fast for ever.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas was just
        rising to announce his resolve when the sound of a trumpet was heard
        at the gate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
        311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        the fortress. It was a herald bringing a message from the young
        King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Have you aught to say to me in private?”</span> asked
        Judas, when the man was brought in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> he answered; <span class="tei tei-q">“my
        message is one that all may hear.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then delivered
        it, reading the words from a parchment which he carried in his hand,
        and which bore the sign-manual (an impression of the seal-ring dipped
        in ink) of Antiochus Eupator, as well as that of Lysias. They ran
        thus:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Antiochus, surnamed Eupator, King of Syria and Egypt,
        offers to the people of the Jews peace and friendship. He permits
        them to worship God after the manners and customs of their fathers,
        and he hereby revokes all the edicts which the King, his father,
        having been misinformed by unfaithful advisers, issued against the
        said nation of the Jews.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Never was there a
        more surprising, a more unexpected change in the position of affairs.
        But it might have been foreseen by those who had watched with a full
        knowledge of the truth, the recent course of events.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Despatches had
        reached Lysias from Antioch which convinced him that he and his young
        charge had enemies to reckon with who would be far more formidable
        than Judas and his followers. Philip had returned from Persia with
        the host of Epiphanes, and had assumed the management of affairs, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312"
        id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Philip was a dangerous rival.
        Were he to prevail, his own position as the chief adviser of the King
        would be untenable; and the King himself would very probably be
        dispossessed by some other claimant to the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He laid the case,
        or at least so much as it was necessary to explain, before the
        boy-King. The lad, who was indeed intelligent beyond his years, at
        once acquiesced in the advice, that easy conditions of peace should
        be offered to the garrison.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then an assembly
        of the soldiers was summoned. All the officers were invited by name,
        and, after the usual fashion of such gatherings, as many of the men
        as could crowd into the chambers were also present. To them Lysias
        said nothing about the news from Antioch, which it would be better,
        he thought, to conceal as long as possible; but he dwelt on the
        useless hardships which they were all enduring.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Famine and the pestilence are upon us,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and we decay daily. But the place to which
        we lay siege is strong, and we are no nearer to the taking of it than
        we were six months since. Now, therefore, let us offer to these men,
        who are neither robbers nor murderers, peace and liberty, that they

        "font-size: 100%">A PEACEFUL INTERVAL.</span></span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was one of the
        stipulations of the peace offered by the young Antiochus, and
        accepted by Judas, that the King should be admitted with due ceremony
        into the surrendered fortress. It was to be a formal acknowledgment
        of his authority, but nothing more. No change, it was understood, was
        to be made; the King and his attendants were not to go beyond the
        court which it was lawful for the Gentiles to enter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the morrow,
        accordingly, the boy-King came with a splendid procession of nobles
        and officers. In front marched a company of soldiers, picked from the
        whole army for their beauty of feature and commanding stature, and
        gorgeous with their gilded arms. Then, in the order of their dignity,
        came the high officers of state; last, the young monarch himself, the
        Governor Lysias leading him by the hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The approach to
        the Temple was thronged by a crowd of eager spectators, none of whom
        were more profoundly interested in the sight than the little Daniel,
        with his cousins, Miriam and Judith. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>child’s fancy had been caught by all that he had
        heard of the young prince. It seemed strange to him, almost beyond
        belief, that a lad, a little older, it was true, than himself, but
        younger than Miriam, should have power to do so much harm.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother,”</span> he said one day to Ruth,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“why does God let him hurt so many people? It
        is all his doing that the brave soldiers are shut up in the Temple,
        and that we have so little to eat. Will he not be punished for it
        some day? I suppose, as he is a king, nobody can punish him except
        God. But He will, won’t He, mother?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came the
        unexpected news of the peace; and nothing would satisfy little Daniel
        but that he must see the boy-King received in the Temple. Eagerly did
        the child watch him as he walked in his little suit of armour, which
        the most skilful artizans in Antioch had made so light as not to be
        too much for his strength, and great was his delight when Eupator,
        catching a sight of his eager face, kissed his hand to him with a
        pleasant smile. That smile he never forgot, though it is true that
        his old anger against the young king returned next day almost as
        vehemently as ever when he heard that orders had been given that the
        ramparts of the Temple fortress were to be broken down, and that the
        Greek soldiers, anxious to depart, had begun the work of destruction
        the very hour at which the edict had been published.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though this breach
        of faith was a great blow to the patriots, still they had much to
        console them. In the first place, to their intense relief, the Greek
        army marched away, and the Holy City was no more defiled by the
        presence of the heathen. Then the renegade Menelaüs, whom every
        faithful Jew hated with a more bitter hatred than he felt for the
        heathen themselves, went away, but not of his own free choice, with
        the King. Lysias had an honest man’s dislike for a traitor, and
        indeed did not scruple to say that this impostor, who was neither
        good Jew nor real Greek, had done more than any one else to cause the
        recent troubles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not less welcome
        was the end of the Sabbatical year. This of itself would not, of
        course, have relieved the pressure of scarcity; but there was help
        from without which before had not been available. Hitherto the Jews
        had been under a ban; they were enemies of the Syrian King, and none
        who desired to be his friends would have any dealings with them. Now
        all was changed. The ban was removed. The people were in favour with
        Eupator and Lysias. A brisk trade commenced, and supplies of food
        came in abundance. With good heart and hope the people set themselves
        to their work. From being a city of mourning Jerusalem became gay and
        cheerful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
        gladness culminated in the Feast of Tabernacles, always the most
        joyous of Jewish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
        317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>festivals, and now celebrated with special
        manifestations of delight. Never had the people felt so keenly the
        pleasure of seeming at least to return to the simple life of earlier
        times, the rustic enjoyments of a nation that had not yet learnt to
        dwell in cities. It was the ordinance that for seven days the
        Israelite should dwell, not in his house, but in a booth of boughs.
        For days waggon-loads without number of the boughs of the olive, the
        palm, the pine, the myrtle, and other trees which had a foliage
        sufficiently thick for the purpose, were brought into the city. When
        a house had a roof of a convenient size and situation, the booth was
        built upon it; in many cases it was set up in the court. Those who
        had come from elsewhere to share in the festival set up their booths
        in the court of the Temple, in the street of the Water Gate, and in
        the street of the Gate of Ephraim. It was a beautiful sight at any
        time, and now the fresh foliage hid the scars of many a grievous
        wound that had been inflicted during the years of desolation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every day, at the
        time of the morning sacrifice, each Israelite, gaily dressed in
        holiday attire, made his way to the Temple. Each carried in one hand
        a bundle of the same branches that were used in the building of the
        booths, and in the other a fruit of the citron tree. When all the
        company was assembled, and the parts of the victim had been laid upon
        the altar, a priest was seen approaching with a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>golden ewer in his hand. He had filled it
        at the pool of Siloam, and he brought it into the court of the Temple
        through the Water Gate. The trumpets sounded as he came in and
        ascended the slope of the altar. On each side of this were two silver
        basins; into that on the eastern side he poured the sacred water;
        while another priest poured wine into that on the western. Then the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hallel”</span><a id="noteref_21" name=
        "noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> was
        sung; when the singers came to the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“O
        give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good, because His mercy endureth
        for ever,”</span> each Israelite shook his bundle of branches; he did
        it again when they sang, <span class="tei tei-q">“Save, Lord, I
        beseech Thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech Thee, send now
        prosperity;”</span> and a third time at the words, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good: for His
        mercy endureth for ever.”</span> In the evening there was a grand
        illumination. Eight lamps, so large and so high that they sent their
        light over nearly the whole of the city, were set up in the court of
        the Temple, while many of the people carried flambeaux in their
        hands. Meanwhile a company of Levites, standing on the steps of the
        Court of the Women, chanted to the music of cymbal and the harp the
        fifteen <span class="tei tei-q">“Songs of Degrees.”</span><a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These were the
        public rejoicings; the private festivities were on the most liberal
        scale. Never did <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg
        319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        maxim that he who fails to contribute according to his means to the
        general joy is a sinner above other men meet with a more hearty
        acceptance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah with his
        daughters and little Daniel were watching the ceremonies of the last
        and greatest day of the feast from the roof of the Governor’s house,
        where they were joined by Micah and by Joseph, who, it will be
        remembered, had shared with him the disastrous command of the city
        during the absence of Judas in Gilead. Joseph was exultant; Micah’s
        face was grave and even sad.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thank the Lord, Azariah,”</span> cried Joseph,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“for He has dealt with the traitor after his
        deservings.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whom mean you?”</span> asked Azariah; <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King has caused him to be put to death. He was in
        little favour when they took him home, for Lysias said that he had
        wrought all the mischief that had been done. And when they came to
        Antioch the matter of Oniah was brought against him, for there were
        many who loved the old man, and had taken it ill that his death had
        not been fully avenged. And when the young King heard the story,
        Menelaüs being present, and having nothing to say against it, he
        cried, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I wonder that the King, my father,
        suffered this murderer to escape, but he shall <span class=

        cast him alive into the Tower of Ashes.’</span> So they took him and
        did as the King had commanded.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And what is the Tower of Ashes?”</span> asked the little
        Daniel, who had been listening to this conversation with a sort of
        terrified interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Micah answered his
        question. <span class="tei tei-q">“At Berea is a tower, the bottom of
        which is full of ashes, and in the tower is a machine which revolves
        and plunges the criminal who is bound to it deep into the ashes until
        he is smothered. But as for this unhappy man, the Lord have mercy
        upon him!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joseph turned
        fiercely upon him. <span class="tei tei-q">“I marvel,”</span> he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you should pray for this fellow,
        who was worse than the heathen. He has but had his
        deservings.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And where should I be, if I had had mine?”</span>
        answered Micah. <span class="tei tei-q">“I walked in the same way
        with this Menelaüs, and sinned against the Law, even as he sinned,
        and but that God had mercy upon me, surely I had come to the same
        end.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        God has forgiven you, for He knows how bravely you have fought for
        Him, and how many of the heathen you have killed with your
        sword.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And who shall be high priest in this traitor’s
        place?”</span> asked Joseph, after a pause. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“For Oniah, the son of him that was slain at Antioch, is
        in the land of Egypt, and he takes part with the unfaithful brethren
        who would build another Temple among the temples of the heathen,
        leaving the place which the Lord has chosen to set His name
        there.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And if the House of Zadok have perished, why should not
        Judas, son of Mattathias, be high priest?”</span> said Azariah.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He is of a principal house among the sons of
        Aaron, and the Lord has been with him always.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joseph had never
        forgiven Judas for his own disaster. His was one of those mean
        natures that justify the saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“The injured
        may forgive, the injurer never.”</span> The captain had treated him
        with the same generous kindness which he had showed to Azariah, but
        this kindness had not been received in the same temper. On the
        contrary it rankled in his mind, till by a strange, yet not uncommon,
        perversion of feeling, it had produced a positive sense of injury. He
        now broke out:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay, my friend, you say too much. That he has won
        victories I deny not; but was the Lord with him when he fled before
        the face of the heathen at Beth-Zachariah, or when Beth-zur was
        yielded up to Lysias, or when we had well-nigh perished with famine
        in the siege, or when the King broke down the ramparts of the Temple?
        Not so: what<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg
        322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ever
        the people may shout or sing in his praise, he too has known defeat,
        even as we have.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This I know,”</span> said Azariah, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that whereas we were trodden underfoot by the heathen
        till there was no life left in us, now we are risen and stand
        upright.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how long, think you,”</span> returned Joseph,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“will it be so with us? Did we drive away the
        King, or did he not rather depart of his own accord, because of what
        he and his counsellors had heard of the doings of Philip? And will he
        not return, and the end be worse than the beginning?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azariah answered,
        with some heat, <span class="tei tei-q">“As for that which may happen
        hereafter, I say nothing. These things are in the hand of God. But
        that the young Antiochus departed to his own land was, I doubt not at
        all, of the Lord’s doing. Why, even this child knows the story of
        Sennacherib, and the words which Isaiah the prophet spoke to Hezekiah
        when the King was faint-hearted, and could not see how there should
        be any deliverance for Israel. Did not the prophet say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘He shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own
        land?’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joseph said
        nothing. With all his meanness and littleness he was a patriot, and
        really loved his country; and it went against his heart and
        conscience to prophesy evil against her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the little

        the same time he signalled to his wife that she should take the child
        out of the room. The signal, however, was too late. The quick-witted
        little fellow had heard what had been said, and immediately jumped to
        the conclusion that something had been heard about the boy-King. His
        mind was occupied, it might almost be said, day and night with the
        thought of the young Eupator. He scarcely knew whether he hated or
        loved him; but the brilliant figure of the lad had caught his
        imagination. He lived, as imaginative children often will, a sort of
        second life in thinking of him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        he did break his promise so shamefully.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boy burst into
        a passionate fit of tears, which all his mother’s caresses and
        attempts at consolation were for some time unable to stop. When the
        violence of his grief had spent itself he said—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh! father, tell me about him. Were they very cruel to
        him? And how did it happen? I thought that kings killed people, but I
        did not know that any one could kill them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Listen, my child, and I will try to explain it to you.
        The father of Eupator, the boy who is just dead, was not rightfully
        King. He came after his elder brother, and this elder brother had a
        son named Demetrius, who ought to have succeeded his father. But this
        son had been sent to Rome as a hostage.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“When you are going to trust some one about whom you do
        not feel quite sure, you take something from him that he values very
        much, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘You will lose this unless you
        behave well.’</span> So Demetrius’s father gave his son to the Romans
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325"
        id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to keep, and the Romans were
        sure that as long as they had the child his father would not do
        anything that they did not like. Well, as I told you, Demetrius was
        sent to Rome to be security for his father’s good behaviour, and
        there he lived all the time that Antiochus, whom they called
        Epiphanes, was King. And when Epiphanes died Demetrius asked the
        Romans to let him go, that he might claim the kingdom which, he said,
        belonged to him and which his cousin Eupator was too young to be able
        to govern. But they would not let him go, and I have been told that
        Lysias bribed some of the chief men among them, and these persuaded
        the rest. At last he got tired of waiting for leave, and he ran away
        from Rome without it, and landed at a place called Tripolis, not very
        far from Antioch, with only twenty or thirty men with him. But as
        soon as ever the soldiers at Antioch heard of his coming, they
        declared that they would have him for their King.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, if they did not know much that was good about him,
        they knew nothing that was bad. Anyhow they all rose in his favour;
        and they seized the young King and Lysias the Governor and brought
        them to him, and asked him what they should do with them. He would
        not say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Kill them,’</span> for, after all,
        the little boy was his cousin, and had not done him any harm. And he
        did not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name=
        "Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>like to say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Keep them alive,’</span> for he was afraid
        that his cousin might some day have his throne; so he only said to
        the soldiers, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Take care that they do not see
        my face.’</span> So the soldiers—they were the young King’s own
        guard—took him and killed him, and Lysias with him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had heard
        this the child allowed his mother to take him away. He saw that his
        father, usually so calm, was anxious and troubled, and, wise with a
        wisdom beyond his years—the fruit of the troubled life which he and
        his had been leading—would not ask him any more questions. But that
        night, when his mother came to give him the last kiss before he went
        to sleep, he had many things to say to her. Poor little fellow! he
        had seen many terrible sights, which all his parents’ care could not
        keep from his eyes, and had heard of many more, and he could not help
        asking again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Did they hurt him very
        much?”</span> and when she had comforted him as best she could on
        this score, he showed that there was another trouble in his mind.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! mother,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“do you remember that when he ordered the walls of the
        fortress to be pulled down, I prayed to God that he might be punished
        for breaking his promise? and only the other day, when Joseph was
        talking about his coming back, I said—something in me seemed to make
        me say it almost without my knowing—<span class="tei tei-q">‘He shall
        fall by the sword in his own land.’</span> And now he is <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>punished, for he has fallen by the sword.
        Do you think that God listened to me, and did it because I said these
        things? But, mother, I did not hate him very much; sometimes I used
        to think I loved him; and oh! it would be dreadful to think that I
        had anything to do with his being killed!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My son,”</span> said Ruth, <span class="tei tei-q">“do
        you remember what our father Abraham said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Shall not the Judge of all the earth do
        right’</span>?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes, mother, I am sure that He will do right; and the
        King did deserve to be punished. But perhaps his counsellors told him
        to do it; and I am sure that if I was told to do something that was
        wrong by people that I loved, I should be very likely to do
        it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When his mother
        came to see him some hours afterwards she found him asleep, but his
        pillow was wet with tears, and now and then a little sob showed how
        deeply the trouble had entered into his little heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was trouble
        in older and wiser hearts than his. The Jews had hoped much from the
        boy-King. His bad faith in the matter of the Temple fortress they had
        willingly put down to evil counsellors, and they could not forget
        that he had given them terms, good beyond all their hopes, when they
        were in the last extremity. The death of Lysias was a more serious
        loss. He was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg
        328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        pacificator; to his influence they ascribed the conciliatory policy
        of the young Antiochus. And now he was gone. Would his death be the
        signal of a change? Would Demetrius go back to the ways of the mad
        Antiochus? or had he learnt prudence, if not mercy, from his sojourn
        among the Romans and the bitter experience of an exile?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Opinion was
        divided. Some hoped, some feared; but all were resolved that they
        would never give way, that they would defend to the last drop of
        their blood the freedom which they had won. Azariah, whose temper of
        mind had gathered a certain gloom from the unhappy experiences of his
        life, took a desponding view of the situation. Micah, on the
        contrary, was cheerful, and he had some strong arguments to back him
        up.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Remember,”</span> he said to his brother-in-law one day,
        when the subject had been discussed at some length between them,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that I have had opportunities for forming a
        judgment which, happily for you, have not come in your way. I once
        saw much of these Greeks—I am ashamed to remember the time, but still
        it would be folly not to make use of what I then learnt—and I am sure
        that that madman Antiochus did not represent what they really feel.
        You don’t know how they despise all barbarians as they call them;
        and, despising them, they are disposed to let them alone. They don’t
        want us to worship their gods; they think that we are not
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329"
        id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>good enough. But Antiochus was
        mad with pride and arrogance, and it is not likely that any one else
        should be found to follow his steps. We may have trouble; indeed I
        feel sure that we shall; but depend upon it there will not be another
        such attempt as the madman made to stamp out our
        religion.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the tidings
        that soon after reached Jerusalem from Antioch seemed to justify this
        forecast. There seemed to be trouble ahead, but it was not trouble of
        the sort which had brought desolation upon the Holy City. A
        deputation from that party among the Jews which affected Greek habits
        and Greek practices had been admitted to the presence of the new
        King. They had accused Judas, the son of Mattathias, of having driven
        them from their land, and of being an enemy to the sovereignty of the
        Greeks. Demetrius had listened to their representations, and had
        conferred the office of high priest on Alcimus,<a id="noteref_23"
        name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> the
        leader of the malcontents, and had promised to send a force which
        would instal him in his office, and at the same time take vengeance
        on Judas and the Chasidim. This force was to be under the command of
        Bacchides, one of the most trusted of his counsellors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A high priest of
        the stamp of Menelaüs—for such Alcimus was known to be—would be
        anything but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg
        330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>welcome. Probably it would be necessary to
        resist him and his proceedings by force. Still things were not as bad
        as they might have been. That King Demetrius should have appointed a
        high priest at all showed that he was not bent, as Epiphanes had
        been, on extirpating the Jewish faith. With such doubtful comfort as
        this assurance could give they were compelled to be satisfied and to
        await the development of events.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The new high
        priest arrived at Jerusalem, escorted by a powerful force under the
        command of Bacchides. None but absolute renegades were glad to see
        Greek soldiers again lording it in the streets of Jerusalem; but
        otherwise there was a wide difference of opinion as to the duty of
        faithful Jews with regard to the reception of the stranger. Alcimus
        and his Greek companions were loud in their professions of good will.
        They intended, they said, nothing but benefits to the people. All
        would be well if they were only received in the same spirit in which
        they came.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas and his
        brothers received these assurances with profound incredulity. They
        and their immediate followers had thought it prudent to leave the
        city. There had been no opportunity of properly repairing the walls
        of the Temple fortress, and without some such stronghold to serve as
        shelter in case of need, they would, they felt, be at the mercy of
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name=
        "Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Greeks. In the position
        to which they had withdrawn there was a hot discussion. Judas, as
        usual, urged the counsels of prudence and common sense. It was easy,
        he said, to make these professions of peace and good will—so easy
        that, without some substantial guarantee of their sincerity, it would
        be madness to risk anything on the strength of them. Alcimus, or
        Eliakim—he must own that he did not like or trust these double-named
        Jews, for they were often double-faced also—might be thinking of
        nothing but peace; but why did he come with an army behind him? He
        might have been sure, sprung as he was from the race of Aaron, that
        none of his countrymen would harm him. Why had he surrounded himself
        with a multitude of godless heathen who would be only too likely to
        harm them? <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us wait”</span>—this was his
        final advice—<span class="tei tei-q">“till he and his friends give us
        some proof that they really mean what they say.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Chasidim were
        loud and vehement in their opposition to this counsel. Joseph, whose
        bitterness and jealousy had not been weakened by the lapse of time,
        constituted himself their spokesman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Law,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“plainly declares that there shall be a high priest.
        There are acts, acts of the highest importance, even necessity, which
        only he can perform. Our worship without him is maimed and imperfect.
        We cannot expect that there will be a blessing upon it, that, lacking
        this essential part, our sacrifices will be accepted or our prayers
        heard. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name=
        "Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>And now we have a high
        priest that is of the race of Aaron. He promises—and why should we
        not believe him?—that his purposes towards us are for good and not
        for evil. Let us go to him, and do him the honour that is due to his
        office. If harm come of it, we shall have at least obeyed the
        commandment of God.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas and his
        brothers, with such faithful followers as Seraiah and Micah, stood
        resolutely aloof, but they could not control the action of the
        enthusiasts. A large body of the Chasidim paid to Alcimus a formal
        visit. They welcomed him to the seat of his office; they paid him
        their homage; intimating at the same time that there were grievances
        for which they asked redress and abuses which needed reform. Nothing
        could have exceeded the show of politeness and even friendship with
        which they were received. Alcimus made the most solemn protestations
        that neither they nor their friends should suffer any harm. He could
        only regret that unfounded suspicions had kept away the great soldier
        who had done so much for his country and whom he would have had so
        much pleasure in welcoming. They were invited to a banquet, which had
        been duly prepared, they were assured, in obedience to the
        requirements of the Law, and of which they could partake without any
        fear of contracting impurity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the banquet
        there was to be a conference. The proceedings began, and were
        continued for some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg
        334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>time
        without interruption, though Alcimus could scarcely control his
        impatience at what he thought the unreasonable demands of the bigots.
        Meanwhile Bacchides, who had hitherto kept himself in the background,
        was quietly surrounding the council-chamber with troops. Joseph was
        in the midst of an harangue when the doors were thrown open, a
        company of soldiers marched in, and arrested every member of the
        deputation. It was now the turn of Alcimus to retire into the
        background. He had served his purpose, acting, it may be said, as a
        decoy, and, thanks to him, some of the most inveterate enemies of the
        Greek party had been entrapped. The Greek commander made short work
        with his prisoners. Alcimus went through the farce of interceding for
        them, but he never expected, and, perhaps, never intended, to obtain
        his requests. Sixty of them were executed on the spot, and the rest
        were cast into prison. The bodies of the victims were hurriedly
        thrown into carts, drawn outside the city, and left to be the prey of
        the vulture and the wild dog.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horror and
        dismay which spread through the city with the news of the bloody deed
        were such as it would be impossible to describe. The victims were
        well-known men, and, for the most part, as much respected as they
        were known. There was a frantic rush to do honour to the remains of
        the martyred patriots. But Bacchides had foreseen that <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this would probably occur, and had
        surrounded the place with a cordon of soldiers. The people could do
        nothing but stand upon the walls while the birds and beasts of prey
        mangled the corpses, and mingle, in their impotent rage, curses on
        the murderers, with lamentations over the dead. In more than one of
        their national hymns they found a fitting expression of their grief;
        but none was more suitable to the circumstances of the time than the
        words of the seventy-ninth Psalm: <span class="tei tei-q">“The dead
        bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of
        the heaven, and the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
        Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem, and
        there was none to bury them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conduct of
        Judas did not, as may be supposed, escape censure. It is the first
        impulse of a multitude in the presence of some great disaster to
        throw the blame upon its rulers, and the Jews, in their anger and
        grief, felt and yielded to it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said an old man, who had lost a brother and
        a son in the massacre, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was too prudent to
        trust himself to the heathen; he stood aloof from their danger, and
        when they offered themselves up as a sacrifice, he was not
        there.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Did he not warn them and entreat them, and
        they took no heed to his words?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But had he and his men of war gone with <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them,”</span> returned the other,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they had not been left without defence. But
        now they went as sheep to the slaughter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What can you look for when the sheep will go where the
        shepherd does not lead them? And as for Judas, did he ever spare his
        life? Has he not taken it in his hand time after time, fighting with
        a few men against thousands of the heathen? And tell me now,”</span>
        went on the speaker, <span class="tei tei-q">“to whom should we have
        looked for deliverance had Judas also been slain with these? The Lord
        has had mercy upon His people, lest they should be utterly cast down,
        and has left unto them their captain.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
        popular opinion was strongly in Judas’s favour. Then came another
        turn of events. The Greek general, weary of his sojourn among a
        people that hated him, marched out of Jerusalem, and encamped in one
        of the suburbs,<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
        "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> where he
        could keep his troops better in hand, and not expose them to the
        daily risk of collision with a hostile population. This place, too,
        he shortly evacuated, returning with the main part of his army to
        Antioch, though he left a small force to support Alcimus, who would
        now, he thought, with this help, be able to hold his own.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before he went
        he committed another deed only less atrocious than the treacherous
        massacre <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg
        337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        the Chasidim. Every partisan, or supposed partisan, of Judas whom he
        could either entrap or seize was mercilessly slaughtered. Nor did
        Greeks, who, from motives of expediency or under pressure of superior
        force, had submitted to Judas, escape.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Bacchides
        imagined that these cruelties would strengthen the position of the
        renegade high priest he was greatly mistaken. Alcimus was more
        universally, more fervently hated than even Jason or Menelaüs had
        been. The disappointment caused by this renewal of troubles was all
        the more bitter because it had succeeded to hopes that seemed so well
        established. And every one felt that it was Alcimus who was to blame.
        His greed and ambition had disturbed the peace which they were
        beginning to enjoy. On his head was all the innocent blood that had
        been shed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now a new
        horror was added to all that the unhappy country had endured. It was
        no longer Jew fighting against Greek, but Jew against Jew. Civil war,
        always more bitter, more ruthless than the very fiercest struggle
        between strangers, broke out. The renegades rallied to Alcimus. Their
        interests were bound up with his cause. Some of them had committed
        themselves so deeply that they could not hope for pardon from the
        patriots. Others had a genuine dislike for Jewish severity and a
        liking for Greek license, and fought for all that, as they thought,
        made life worth living. But the number <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of these philo-Greek partisans was but small,
        and the popular feeling was unmistakably against them, and Judas felt
        himself strong enough to assert his position vigorously. He was not
        now a partisan leader, raising the standard of revolt against
        established authority; he was himself the established authority,
        justified in punishing all that presumed to rebel against him. This
        judicious display of firmness, of what might even be called severity,
        vastly strengthened his position. The waverers who always go with the
        strongest, who care little for principle, but most for self-interest
        and safety, when they saw that the sword of Judas was a more
        immediate danger to his enemies than the sword of the Syrian King,
        hesitated no longer about joining him. Alcimus found himself deserted
        by all but a few desperate partisans. The commander of his Greek
        auxiliaries declared himself unable to give him sufficient help.
        Accordingly he had no alternative but to give up the unequal contest,
        and to hurry back to Antioch, where he might lay his complaints
        before King Demetrius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The complaints
        which Alcimus carried to the Syrian King at Antioch were eagerly
        listened to. Demetrius was eager, as new rulers frequently are, to
        reverse the policy of his predecessor. Eupator had yielded to the
        persistency of these obstinate Jews, but he would show them that it
        was he and not they who was master. A new expedition should be sent,
        and this pestilent rebel, who, after all, had been shown not to be
        invincible, should be extinguished for ever. There was some doubt as
        to who should be put in command; but ultimately the King’s choice
        fell upon Nicanor, the same that had been associated with Gorgias in
        an earlier campaign. He had been since promoted to the exalted office
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“Commander of the Elephants,”</span> and
        was in high favour with Demetrius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more Judas
        found himself obliged to retire from Jerusalem, where he could not
        command the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg
        340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>liberty of movement that was necessary for his
        safety; but he remained in the neighbourhood, and watched the
        development of events.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicanor’s first
        idea was to repeat the treachery of Bacchides, and to get Judas and
        his brothers into his power. A letter, written in studiously friendly
        terms, was sent to the Jewish captain, suggesting a conference, at
        which the matters in dispute might easily be settled. Judas was not
        likely, especially after recent experience, to fall into the trap;
        but nevertheless he did not refuse the invitation. He came to the
        conference, but he came with a strong guard, and not till he had
        secured such conditions as seemed to make a treacherous surprise
        impossible. The meeting took place. Side by side, on two chairs of
        state, sat the two generals, each with their armed guard within call.
        On either side was a barrier, beyond which no one that did not belong
        to the stipulated number of attendants was allowed to pass. The
        conversation between the two was friendly and animated. Nicanor’s
        treacherous purpose did not prevent him from having a genuine
        admiration for the character and achievements of his great adversary;
        and the praises which he heaped upon him were perfectly sincere. But
        this feeling did not make him at all less anxious to get this
        formidable hero into his power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Negotiations had
        not proceeded very far, in fact had not got beyond the initial stage,
        when a pre<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg
        341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>concerted signal warned Judas that there was
        danger at hand. Self-possessed as ever, he showed no sign of having
        penetrated his companion’s intention. A point of some importance was
        raised by Nicanor, and Judas intimated that he could not deal with it
        until he had consulted his council. Rising from his seat, without
        allowing the least indication of disturbance to be seen in his
        manner, he bade the Greek general a courteous farewell, rejoined his
        guard, and was soon out of the reach of danger. But when he was again
        among his friends, he did not conceal his feelings. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He is a false liar,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and, so long as he lives, I will see his face again no
        more.”</span> The words were to have a singularly close
        fulfilment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicanor, finding
        his attempted fraud unsuccessful, resolved to try force. He marched
        against Judas, who, for military reasons, had retired as far as
        Samaria, and gave him battle at Capharsalama. But the plans of
        Nicanor were conceived with more haste than prudence. He delivered
        his attack under unfavourable conditions, and received a crushing
        defeat in which he lost fully five thousand men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus baffled for a
        second time, he returned to Jerusalem in a frenzy of rage. On the day
        after his arrival he went, followed by an armed guard, to the Temple,
        and forced his way into the Great Court. It was the time of the
        morning sacrifice, and the trembling priests came down from the altar
        to salute him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg

        into my hands——”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priests
        attempted to speak, but he silenced them with an imperious
        gesture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“So be it. Then I will take him by force. And when I have
        taken him, and dealt with him after his deserts, then——”</span> he
        paused for a moment, and held out his right hand with a threatening
        gesture <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name=
        "Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>towards the
        altar—<span class="tei tei-q">“then I will burn this house with fire;
        even as the Chaldæans burnt it in the days of your fathers, so will I
        burn it. All the gods of heaven and hell confound me, if I do not
        burn it, as a man burns a brand in the fire.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So speaking he
        turned away, and without deigning to salute the terrified priests,
        quitted the precincts of the Temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he was gone
        the priests stood weeping and praying before the altar. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O Lord,”</span> they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“for
        the blasphemies wherewith Thine enemies blaspheme Thee, reward Thou
        them sevenfold into their bosom. Thou didst choose this house to be
        called by Thy name, and to be a house of prayer for Thy people.
        Avenge Thyself, therefore, of this man and his host, and cause them
        to fall by the sword.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicanor had sent
        to Antioch for reinforcements, for he would not fail again for lack
        of strength or due preparation, and marching out of Jerusalem, he
        awaited their arrival at the western end of the Pass of Beth-horon.
        Judas, who, after his victory near Samaria, had followed his beaten
        enemy, took up his position at Adasa, an elevated position about four
        miles to the north of Jerusalem. He thus put himself between Nicanor
        and the Holy City. But he had only three thousand men to match
        against a force three times as numerous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fate of the
        Sanctuary of Israel now seemed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>to be trembling in the balance. If Nicanor was
        victorious its doom was sealed. He had vowed, with all the emphasis
        of an awful curse upon himself, that if he came again in peace he
        would utterly destroy it. Day after day the women and the old men
        left behind were continually in the Temple, which, perhaps, they
        might in a few days see destroyed before their eyes. And when at
        night the Temple gates were shut they sought their homes to fast and
        to renew in private their prayers for the deliverance of the Holy
        Place, and the victory of the armies of the Lord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By a notable
        coincidence the anniversary of a great danger and a great deliverance
        was approaching. Within a few days the Feast of Purim would be
        celebrated. Would the time bring with it a fresh cause for
        thanksgiving, or a disaster so terrible that all the deliverances of
        the past would seem to be of no <span class=
        "tei tei-corr">avail?</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        when they had returned from their daily visit to the

        children, liked it better the oftener he heard it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Ruth told the
        familiar tale again—how the wicked Haman, wroth that the honest
        Mordecai would not pay him reverence, slandered the whole nation to
        the King till he obtained a decree for their <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>slaughter, how Mordecai went to Esther the
        Queen, a Jewess herself, and bade her save her people, though she
        risked her own life to do it, how the wicked Haman was hanged on the
        gallows which he had made for his enemy, and the Jews had license
        given them by the King to slay their adversaries in every city of the
        kingdom of Persia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And this Nicanor,”</span> she went on, when she had

        Haman. May the God against whom he has uttered his blasphemies cast
        him down and destroy him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the hour
        of battle was drawing near. Judas and his little army were
        bivouacking on the hills of Adasa. It was the 12th day of the month
        Adar—about equivalent to the beginning of March—and on that high
        ground the night air was cold and piercing. Seraiah, Azariah, and
        Micah were sitting by a camp-fire, and talking over the chances of
        the coming struggle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the eve of
        the great Purim feast—the memorial which had been kept now for three
        hundred years of the great deliverance which God had wrought for His
        people by the hands of Mordecai and Esther. The thoughts of the
        comrades naturally turned to this memorable day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Where and how,”</span> said Micah to his companions,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“shall we keep the Purim feast?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Shall we keep it at all?”</span> said Azariah, always
        somewhat disposed to take a gloomy view of their <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>prospects. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        Mordecai we have, none more steadfast; and there is a Haman against
        us even more cruel and wicked than he of Persia. But Ahasuerus is
        against us, nor do I see who shall turn him from his
        purpose.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> said Seraiah, with a smile, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“at least we can use our swords without his
        license.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While they were
        talking they observed a figure emerge from out the darkness into the
        circle of light made by the flames. They rose to their feet, for it
        was the captain himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sit down, my friends,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we shall be on our feet enough to-morrow.”</span> And as
        he spoke, he took his seat on the ground by their side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He went on, after
        a few minutes of silence, <span class="tei tei-q">“So Azariah doubts
        what sort of a Purim festival we shall keep. As for myself I doubt
        not. But I have been thinking not so much of Mordecai and
        Haman—though it seems to me a happy thing that we shall fight on the
        day of that deliverance—as of Hezekiah and Rabshakeh. Did not the
        king his master send him to blaspheme the Holy City? And did not
        Hezekiah lay the letter before the Lord? And what was the end? In one
        night the host of the Assyrians was as if it had not been. So shall
        it be, I am persuaded in my heart, with this blaspheming Nicanor and
        his host. He and they shall be utterly destroyed. Yes, Azariah, we
        shall keep our Purim right joyously, after the manner of our fathers.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347"
        id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>But as for our enemies, the
        wine that they shall drink<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=
        "#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> will be
        the wine of the wrath of God.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rose with these
        words, and passed away to spend the rest of the night in meditation
        and prayer. His face next morning, when in the early dawn he stood in
        front of his slender line, was as the face of one who has talked face
        to face with God. Not less rapt than his look was the tone of his
        voice as he poured out the words of his prayer—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O Lord, when they that were sent from the King of the
        Assyrians blasphemed, Thine angel went out and smote an hundred
        fourscore and five thousand of them. Even so destroy Thou this host
        before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken
        blasphemously against Thy Sanctuary, and judge Thou him according to
        his wickedness.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A murmur of assent
        passed through the little army as he uttered these words in that
        clear, thrilling voice which was one of his many gifts as a born
        leader of men. The next moment the line advanced, for Judas followed
        again the successful tactic of attack. Never had his Ironsides
        advanced with a more determined courage; never did they deal fiercer
        blows. The enemy were scattered by their impetuous onset, as the dust
        is scattered before the wind. For all his brutality and falsehood,
        Nicanor was no coward. He stood in the very van of his army,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348"
        id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>giving such cheer as he could
        to his men, and though the lines behind him reeled and shook with
        that movement which is the sure presage of defeat to a soldier’s eye,
        at the approach of the Chasidim, he stood his ground with a dauntless
        courage. He was almost the first to fall, Azariah striking him to the
        ground with a sweeping blow of his sword. It was an appropriate
        ending to the blasphemer that he should receive his death-stroke from
        the weapon that bore the talisman of the Holy Name.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greek line had
        been already beginning to break, but the death of the leader
        completed the rout.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was no common
        victory that Judas won that day. The pursuit was long and bloody. The
        beaten army fled in wild disorder over the country, only to find
        enemies on every hand. Before the sun set it was simply annihilated.
        The tradition of that awful slaughter still lingers in the place, and
        the valley is called <span class="tei tei-q">“The Valley of
        Blood.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their work done,
        the conquerors entered the city. The news of the great deliverance
        had already reached it, and the Feast of Purim was being kept in
        earnest. During the earlier part of the day the suspense and anxiety
        had been too great to admit of anything more than formal rejoicing.
        The customary sacrifices were offered, the customary prayers put up;
        but the thoughts of all were with Judas and <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>his men on the battle-field of Adasa. Then came
        rumours, at first wholly vague and even fictitious—rumours first of
        victory, then of defeat, then of victory again. An hour or so after
        noon a swift runner came in with some authentic tidings. But he could
        not tell of all that happened. This was gradually learnt, and then,
        long after the darkness had closed in, came the advanced guard of the
        conquering army, and, close upon midnight, Judas himself. In spite of
        the darkness, multitudes thronged to meet him. With extravagant
        manifestations of delight, with shouting and singing, with mingled
        tears and laughter, they welcomed him home, the deliverer of the city
        and the Temple. Never before had he been so enthusiastically
        received. And it was well that it should be so, for this was his last
        return as a conqueror.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The feast was
        continued with yet more hearty rejoicing into the next day. And
        indeed from thenceforth the two deliverances were to be celebrated
        together—the salvation which Judas had wrought for his people on the
        battle-field of Adasa, and that which Esther and Mordecai had
        accomplished in the presence-chamber of the Persian King.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ruth would gladly
        have stayed at home and expressed thankfulness in private, but the
        children were urgent with her that she should take them into the
        streets that they might see the people <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        and sister of patriots, she could not refuse; and in the depth of her
        mother’s heart was the proud thought that the little Daniel was not
        an unworthy scion of the race, and that not a few would look with
        admiration on the son of Seraiah, the nephew of Azariah.<a id=

        indeed she did hear as she passed along not a few whispered praises,
        which made her pulses beat quick with thankfulness and joy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they came in
        their rambling into the neighbourhood of the Temple, they found their
        way blocked by a dense crowd, which seemed eagerly pressing forward
        to see some spectacle of surpassing interest. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What is it?”</span> she asked of one who had been, it
        seemed, successful in the struggle for a glimpse of this interesting
        sight, and was now turning away. She could not help shuddering at his
        answer, and called to the children to come away. But the quick ears
        of little Daniel had also caught the man’s reply, and he loudly
        objected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, mother,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        must see. Such things are not for women to see”</span>—the little
        fellow of five or six had already caught the masculine tone of
        superiority—<span class="tei tei-q">“but I am a soldier’s son, and
        shall not be afraid to look. And when I am a man I shall fight for
        God and for His Holy Temple.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are a brave lad, and if I mistake not, and you are
        the nephew of Azariah, there is no one here <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class=

        than you. For ’twas your brave uncle, I am told, that slew that son
        of Belial with his sword.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying he
        lifted the child from the ground, and raised him till he could stand
        upon his shoulders. And what did the little Daniel see that made him
        shout and clap his hands? It was the head and hand of Nicanor nailed
        against the Temple wall. There were the pallid, distorted lips that
        had uttered such proud blasphemies against the Sanctuary of the Lord;
        there was the shrunken, bloodless hand that had been lifted up with
        threats and scorn against His Holy Place. The Lord had indeed
        punished the proud doer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though Jerusalem
        was almost wild with joy—and, indeed, so utterly had the Greek army
        disappeared that deliverance was complete for the time—Judas’s heart
        was full of sad forebodings. Demetrius, he knew, had a steadfastness
        of purpose which augured ill for the future. He was not a madman like
        Epiphanes, nor a child like Eupator; but a cool-headed, resolute man,
        who had seen something of the world, and would carry out his plans
        with both perseverance and skill. Would he sit down under the defeats
        which he had received and recognize Jewish independence? Judas
        thought it unlikely. The vengeance might be laid aside, but it would
        be sure to come. Could he hope to repeat these victories again and
        again? Once before he had been reduced to the greatest straits, and
        had only escaped by an unexpected change in the purpose of the young
        Antiochus. Could he look for anything so marvel<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lous again? Only one plan appeared to him
        to be possible, and he lost no time in calling a council of his
        principal followers and announcing it to them. It was certain, he
        told them, that there would be another war, and a war that would last
        for years, if only the Jewish people could hold out so long.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We warriors may endure it, and if the worst
        come to the worst, we can but fall on the field of battle. But what
        of the old and the weak? What of the women and children? And then we
        are not united. Our foes are of our own household. We have to fight
        not only against the Greek, but against the Jew also. And even in
        this assembly there are some,”</span> he went on, with an emphasis
        which could not be mistaken, <span class="tei tei-q">“who speak evil
        of me behind my back. What, then, shall we do? Speak, any one who has
        counsel to give.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The appeal was met
        with silence, and the speaker continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“You
        have nothing to advise. Listen, therefore, to my counsel, and resist
        it not in haste because it seems strange. There is a nation that,
        rising from a beginning small as ours, has now made for itself a
        great dominion. They are stern to their enemies, but they are just
        and faithful to their friends. Like Israel in the earlier and better
        days, they have no king to rule them after his own pleasure, but an
        assembly that weighs every plan carefully and wisely. And in battle
        they cannot be resisted. Have you heard of such a
        people?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One or two voices
        answered with the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Rome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have said well,”</span> he said; <span class=

        make alliance with them. We shall be, as it were, an outpost for them
        against the King of Syria, against whom they have fought already,
        and, doubtless, will fight again. And they will be a protection to
        us. And with the Romans on our side, we need fear the Greeks no
        more.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One <a name=

        "tei tei-corr">or</span> two of the council were in Judas’s secret.
        Others had guessed, more or less correctly, what he was intending,
        but on most the announcement of his intention fell like a
        thunderbolt. For a few moments there was the pause of intense
        astonishment. Then followed a burst of indignation, in which, of
        course, the Chasidim led the way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Say not,”</span> cried one of their chief speakers,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Romans are like to Israel because they
        have no king. Did not Samuel say to the people, when they fell away
        from their faith because of Nahash the Ammonite, and would have a
        king after the manner of the heathen round about, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘The Lord your God is your King.’</span> And shall we,
        knowing that the Lord Jehovah is the King of the Jews, reject Him
        from reigning over us, and choose us for rulers an assembly of some
        three hundred idolaters. Will you set these men of sin to be lords
        over the City of God?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> replied Judas, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
        speak unadvisedly and rashly. We shall have our own rulers. We shall
        worship after our own way. The Romans will help us in war; and we
        shall help them as we only can. Did not David make friendship and
        alliance with Hiram, King of Tyre, and did not Solomon, in whose
        reign was peace, make that friendship and alliance yet
        closer?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Chasidim
        replied, quoting the prophets and denunciations of the Egyptian
        alliance. <span class="tei tei-q">“Even that accursed
        Rabshakeh,”</span> they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“spoke the
        truth, when he said that Pharaoh, King of Egypt, was a bruised reed
        which will go into a man’s hand and pierce it, if he lean upon it. So
        shall it be with thee, if thou lean upon Rome.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The war of words
        raged long and furiously. The Chasidim had the best of the argument,
        but to the majority of the council the prospect of a settled peace
        was irresistibly alluring. And the influence of Judas, too, was
        overpowering. By a large majority it was decided to send to Rome,
        Eupolemus, the son of John, and Jason, the son of Eleazar,<a id=
        "noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> envoys
        who had been selected for the mission by Judas himself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
        resolution had been passed the council broke up, and the Chasidim
        dispersed with dark <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg
        356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>looks and saddened hearts. The next few days
        passed in uncertainty and gloom. No news had come from Antioch as to
        the movements or intentions of the King. But there was little doubt
        as to what he would do. Whatever they might try to believe in their
        secret hearts they could not but own that when the opportunity came
        Demetrius would deal them a blow into which he would put all his
        strength.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And how would that
        blow be met? Would they be able to escape it, or parry it, or stand
        up against it? The Chasidim, the Ironsides, the men who had been the
        stay and strength of Judas’s armies, who had followed him to victory
        at Beth-zur, at Beth-horon, at Adasa, were miserably dejected. The
        embassy to Rome had broken their spirits. The issue, before so simple
        to these stern souls, narrow, perhaps, in their range of vision, but
        of a clear and single eye, was now confused. While they fought for
        the Lord against the gods of the heathen, they could confidently
        expect that He would show Himself greater than all gods, and this
        faith had made them irresistible. But now, if Jew and Roman were to
        fight side by side, with what confidence could they call upon the
        Lord of Hosts? Was He the Lord of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>
        host, in whose ranks were ranged the battalions of the
        uncircumcised?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some left the
        leader whom they now regarded as unfaithful to his trust, and
        departed to distant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg
        357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>villages, hanging up the swords which they were
        steadfastly resolved not to draw side by side with the heathen.
        Others, in whom the military instinct of discipline, or the personal
        attachment to Judas, as the general who had led them so often to
        victory, were so strong as to overpower all other considerations,
        remained with him. Nothing could take them from his side, but they
        went with heavy hearts and with an outlook on the future that was
        almost hopeless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        embassy started. What the answer of the Romans would be Judas did not
        doubt. They would rejoice to secure the alliance of a people who
        could lend them aid so useful. But would the answer come in time to
        save the city and the Temple from the wrath of Demetrius?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And indeed that
        wrath did not linger. Within a month Bacchides was on his way from
        Antioch with a force of twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse.
        The renegade Alcimus accompanied him, and was to be reinstated in his
        high-priesthood. Their line of march was through Galilee. On their
        way they took the fortified town of Masaloth, and put the garrison to
        the sword. It was about the time of the Passover feast that the
        invaders reached Jerusalem. There was some talk about attacking it;
        but Alcimus was urgent in resisting the proposal. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King’s quarrel,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is with Judas, who is the cause of all this mischief,
        and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name=
        "Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Judas is not here. And
        the King has commanded that I should be replaced in my office; but
        what shall my office profit me if there be no city for me to govern,
        nor Temple in which I am to minister?”</span> Bacchides yielded to
        these representations, and leaving the city unhurt marched to Beeroth
        (a few miles north-east of Jerusalem) and there pitched his camp.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the patriots
        there was such doubt and dismay as had never been felt from the day
        when the aged Mattathias struck the first blow for freedom, not even
        in that dark hour when Judas and his famine-stricken followers were
        about to make their desperate sally from the Temple fortress. It was
        not that they were fighting against overwhelming odds, for they had
        faced as great before; it was that they had lost their unquestioning
        faith in their leader.</p>

        that He will not suffer His servants to be found fighting in the

        Temple all day, assisting at the sacrifices which were being offered,
        and the prayers which were being put up for the success of Judas and
        his army. All night the services would be continued; but the old man
        was utterly worn out, and he had been led back by one of the Levites
        to Seraiah’s house.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        you think that our prayers are heard? I know that God does not
        vouchsafe the visible signs of His presence in His Temple as He did
        in the days of old, and that He does not touch with fire from heaven
        the sacrifice that He accepts. But yet He sometimes seems to answer,
        and we feel in our hearts that He will give us what we ask. Has it
        been so to-day with you, father?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a

        and she knew that before another sun had set, their fate and the fate
        of their country would be decided.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest shook

        seek to be honoured and to make us honoured by the nations round

        be content with the lot of which Isaiah the prophet speaks:

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the night
        before the battle. Day by day and hour by hour the contagion of doubt
        and disaffection had been spreading through the little army that
        followed Judas. He had had three thousand men when he pitched his
        camp at Eleasa, and the three thousand had now dwindled down to less
        than one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas was sitting
        by one of the camp-fires with Azariah and Seraiah, when two soldiers
        came up, bringing bound between them a man who had endeavoured, they
        said, to make his way into the camp. He wore his hat drawn down over
        his forehead, and little of his face could be seen, but there was
        something in his figure that seemed familiar to Azariah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who are you?”</span> said Judas, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and what want you in the camp? Are you for us or for our
        enemies?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg
        363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“My lord,”</span> said the man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“my name is Benjamin, and—for I will hide nothing from
        you—I am a robber. Once I was a soldier in your army, but I broke the
        law, and I fled lest I should be put to death. Now I am come, of my
        own accord, to make such amends for my transgression as I may. Slay
        me, if you will, as I stand here. There is no need of a trial. I have
        been tried and condemned, and I acknowledge that I deserve to die.
        But if you will be merciful, let me fight in the morning by your
        side; and on the morrow, if I yet live, let me suffer the due
        punishment. Life I ask not, but only that I may strike a blow for you
        before I die.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Unbind him,”</span> said Judas to the soldiers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The command was
        obeyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are free to go or stay. But I would gladly have you
        at my side to-morrow, for I have forgotten all but that you are a
        brave man.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benjamin stepped
        forward, and raising the hem of the captain’s robe to his lips,
        kissed it. He then knelt, and putting his head to the ground made as
        though he would have placed Judas’s foot upon his neck.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said the captain, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we want not slaves, but brothers.”</span> And he raised
        him from the ground. <span class="tei tei-q">“And now,”</span> he
        went on, <span class="tei tei-q">“sit down and tell us what you know,
        for I make sure that you have not come empty of news.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benjamin did
        indeed know all that could be known <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>about the enemy, and, indeed, about the
        situation of affairs. To a question from Seraiah he replied that a
        surprise was impossible. The camp was too well guarded and
        watched.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do they know our real numbers?”</span> asked Judas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> was the answer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the deserters have told them.”</span> And he proceeded
        to give a number of names of those who had gone over to the enemy,
        with a readiness and a precision that showed how diligent had been
        his watch.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had told
        all his story, and understood that there was nothing more for him to
        do before the morrow, he wrapped himself in his cloak, and with
        characteristic indifference to the future, fell immediately into a
        profound and dreamless sleep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the
        first rays of light were seen Judas mustered his soldiers and hastily
        numbered them. There were about eight hundred in all, while the army
        of Bacchides, according to the calculations of Benjamin, which seemed
        to have been carefully made, could not be less than twenty
        thousand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judas was not
        dismayed by this disparity of numbers, but was still true to his old
        strategy of attack. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us go up against our
        enemies,”</span> was the exhortation that he addressed to the remnant
        that was still faithful to him. At first they shrank back. The odds
        were too vast; the attempt too desperate. An old soldier who had
        proved his valour <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg
        365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on
        more than one battle-field was put forward as their spokesman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This, sir,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“will be to tempt God. Let us now save our lives.
        Hereafter we will return again, and fight with them. But now we are
        too few.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Judas did not
        waver for a moment. <span class="tei tei-q">“God forbid,”</span> he
        cried, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I should do this thing, and flee
        away from them. Not so; if our time is come, let us die manfully for
        our brethren, and not stain our honour.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His words roused
        once more an answering echo in the hearts of those who heard him.
        They replied with a cry of assent. Victory they could not hope for,
        but their captain they would follow whithersoever he should lead
        them, and as long as he lived they would guard his life with
        theirs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little host
        was then divided into five companies, commanded by Judas and his two
        brothers, Simon and Jonathan, by Seraiah and Micah respectively.
        Azariah, whose standing in the army would have entitled him to a
        separate command, had made a special request that he might be allowed
        to fight by the side of Judas. Benjamin had begged and obtained the
        same privilege.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On both sides the
        trumpets sounded, and both armies moved forward. It was with nothing
        less than astonishment that the Greeks saw the slender proportion of
        the force that was opposed to them. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Most laughed aloud at the thought that such a
        handful of men should venture to stand up against their own
        well-appointed and numerous host. Others, who had before crossed
        swords with Judas’s men knew that that day’s battle, end as it might,
        would be no laughing matter. And indeed they were right. The little
        company of Jewish heroes fought as three centuries before Leonidas
        and his men had fought at Thermopylae.<a id="noteref_28" name=
        "noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> The
        Greeks came on with the same arrogant confidence in their numbers as
        did the picked Persian force against the defenders of Greece, and met
        with a like disastrous repulse. Such was the fury of the Jewish
        soldiers, such their agility and strength, that they kept the
        attacking force in check during the whole day. When night approached
        the Greeks had made, it might almost be said, absolutely no way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
        resistance, successful as it had been, had cost lives, and Judas saw
        his force dwindling before his eyes. Then he made his last desperate
        effort. He threw himself on the right wing, where Bacchides commanded
        in person, broke the line, and drove it in confusion before him.
        Possibly he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg
        367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was
        too rash in his pursuit, but on such a day, when such odds are to be
        encountered, it is scarcely possible to distinguish between rashness
        and courage. Anyhow, it was but a brief success. The left wing closed
        in upon his rear, and he and his gallant band were surrounded. Judas
        was the mark of a hundred swords and spears. For a time he seemed to
        bear a charmed life. Azariah and Benjamin, at his right hand and his
        left, beat down the blows aimed at him, wholly careless of their own
        lives, while he with the long sweep of his fatal sword—the same that
        he had taken from the dead Apollonius on his first battle-field—dealt
        blow after blow, till the ground was covered with the corpses of his
        enemies. But a spear pierced the stout heart of Benjamin, and a
        sword-stroke laid Azariah in the dust; and just as the sun sank
        behind the rugged hills, the hero who had smitten the enemies of his
        country at Bethhoron and Emmaüs, at Elah and at Adasa, had struck his
        last blow. The Hammer lay broken on the rock.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week had passed
        since the fatal day of Eleasa. Judas had been buried in peace in the
        grave where he had laid, five years before, the aged Mattathias. The
        Greek general had been so much impressed with the valour and
        generalship of the Jewish hero that he strictly ordered that no
        indignity should be offered to his remains; and when an envoy came
        from the surviving brothers to ask that the corpse should be given up
        for burial, made no difficulty about granting the request. It was
        only fitting that a brave man should be so honoured. The King, too,
        had been avenged on his enemy, nor did he imagine for a moment that
        the rebels, as he called them, would continue to hold out now that
        their leader had been taken from them. It was impossible for him to
        foresee that those undaunted brothers would maintain the desperate
        struggle until they had wrung from the Syrian king the recognition of
        Jewish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name=
        "Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>independence.
        Accordingly he granted a truce for a fortnight, and even sent some of
        his troops to accompany the funeral procession. It had been a
        touching scene; and when the hero had been laid to rest in the
        sepulchre of his fathers, and the piercing voices of the women, many
        of whom had struggled over the long and toilsome way from Jerusalem
        to be present, raised the cry of lamentation, many of the Greek
        soldiers found themselves moved to tears. This had been the dirge
        that had been sung over the grave:—</p>

        passionately that he was at the side of Judas to the last, and that
        his hope had been at least so far fulfilled that he and the captain
        whom he loved had been saved from drawing sword among the legions of
        Rome. Little Daniel, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg
        370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>too,
        is there, his childish heart sorely troubled with the darkness of a
        dispensation which he cannot understand; and Ruth, comforting herself
        and the children with the thought that he whom they had lost had
        rejoined his own Hannah, and half reproaching herself for her selfish
        joy in having her Seraiah still spared to her. Huldah and Eglah, who
        had been among the mourners at Modin, are there also, and the aged
        priest Shemaiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O father,”</span> cried one of the women, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“tell us why these things are so. Why does God so
        disappoint us of our hopes? We trusted that it had been he who should
        have delivered Israel, and now he is dead!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We must wait,”</span> said the old man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for God’s good time, for He seeth not as we see. Did not
        David think that Solomon, his son, should be the promised king of
        Israel; and, behold, he turned aside to worship idols, and laid such
        burdens on the people that his kingdom was broken in twain? And now
        we, too, have built our hopes upon a man, and they have failed.
        Surely of Judas it might have been said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘He
        shall deliver the needy when he crieth, the poor also, and him that
        hath no helper; he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence,
        and dear shall their blood be in his sight.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We looked,”</span> said Seraiah, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for the time when all kings should fall down before him,
        all nations should do him service. He seemed like the stone cut out
        of the mountain without hands that should <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class=

        for the reign of Messiah the Prince.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And will Messiah come?”</span> cried little Daniel, who
        had been eagerly listening to these words, not understanding all,
        indeed, but catching their general purport.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Surely, my son,”</span> said the old man; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but there are many things to be suffered
        first.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was silent for
        a time, sitting with eyes that seemed to take no heed of the present,
        but to be gazing into a far futurity. At last he spoke.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He loved Israel with all his heart, but he has brought
        upon us a people of iron, harder than the brazen Greeks. He looked to
        them for help that he might build up the walls of Sion, and behold!
        in the days to come they will make Jerusalem a desolation and the
        inhabitants thereof a hissing. And yet, by the Lord’s help, he
        wrought a great deliverance for Israel. He recovered and cleansed the
        Temple, and by his hand the Lord changed the king’s commandment, so
        that we may once more worship Him in the beauty of holiness. And
        surely, had it not been for him, when he put to flight the hosts of
        Lysias, we should have been carried away again into captivity. For
        this was in the heart of our persecutors; only Judas stood in the way
        that it should not be done. The Lord reward him for it, and impute
        not his transgression unto him, for he did not transgress wilfully,
        or out of an evil heart. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg

        be so when Messiah shall come, for come He will at the appointed
        time, seeing that the Lord repenteth Him not of His promises. Verily
        He shall not do homage to any godless bestower of kingdoms, nor
        listen to the voice of the Evil One, though he promise Him all the
        world and the glory of it. With His own right hand and with His holy
        arm will He get Himself the victory!”</span></p>

        MACCABEES.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Maccabee,”</span> probably derived from a
        Hebrew word signifying a <span class="tei tei-q">“Hammer,”</span> was
        originally given to Judas, and afterwards extended to his four
        brothers. They came of a priestly family, belonging to the first and
        noblest of the twenty-four <span class="tei tei-q">“courses,”</span>
        taking its name from a certain Asmon or Chasmon, great-grandfather of
        Mattathias, father of Judas. The five heroic brothers all met with a
        violent death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That of Judas and
        Eleazar has been already described.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John, the eldest,
        was killed in a skirmish, shortly after the death of Judas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jonathan
        maintained himself in power by a clever policy of leaning on Rome,
        and taking part with various claimants to the Syrian crown. He became
        High-priest at some time after the year 153, and perished in 144 by
        the treachery of a certain Tryphon, who usurped for a time the throne
        of Syria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simon succeeded to
        the High-priesthood, and governed the Jewish people for a period of
        eight years with great success. In <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> 143 he
        obtained from the Syrian king a formal recognition of the
        independence of the Jews, and in the following year he got possession
        of the fortress in Jerusalem occupied by the Syrian faction. In 135
        he was treacherously murdered by his son-in-law, Ptolemaeus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simon, who had
        maintained the alliance with Rome, was succeeded by his son John
        Hyrcanus, who followed the same policy, and he again by his son
        Aristobulus, who assumed the title of King in 107.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mariamne, the
        unhappy wife of Herod the Great, belonged to the Maccabean House.
        With the death of her two sons it became extinct.</p>

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
